Limited 1:1 consulting engagements for Fortune 500 enterprises.

## The Approach

After 14 years architecting AI systems across automotive, retail, insurance, FMCG, and telecommunications, I've learned one thing:

**The best solutions come from looking sideways.**

Most consultants stay within their industry expertise. I bring patterns from completely different domains to solve problems that seem intractable.

Healthcare insights solving automotive challenges. Retail strategies transforming manufacturing operations. Mathematical frameworks from applied physics applied to business systems.

### AI Strategy & Architecture
Map your AI maturity. Design scalable systems. Build transformation roadmaps that actually deploy.

### Cross-Industry Pattern Recognition
Apply insights from adjacent industries. Solve problems others can't see because they're looking straight ahead.
:::

### Executive Team Alignment
Get your leadership on the same page about AI transformation. No vendor pitches. Just architecture.
:::

### Implementation Support
I don't just hand you a deck and leave. I work alongside your team until the system is live and scaled.

## Who This Is For

**Fortune 500 enterprises** with real transformation budgets.

**Leaders who are tired of prescriptive AI** and ready for predictive strategy.

**Organizations ready to commit** to systemic change, not point solutions.

This isn't for everyone. But if you're the right fit, the ROI is undeniable.
