I solve problems by finding patterns others miss.

*Sometimes the most elegant solution comes from applying insights from one industry to challenges in another.*

## How I Think About Problems

In mathematics, there's never just one solution to a problem. Some roots are simply more beautiful than others.

This drives how I approach business challenges. After 14 years working across automotive, retail, insurance, FMCG, and telecommunications, I've learned that the breakthrough often comes when you look at a problem through the lens of a completely different industry.

## An Example

When I was working on automotive inventory management, traditional approaches weren't working. The patterns were too complex, the variables too numerous. Then I started thinking about it like a healthcare system managing patient flow.

Suddenly, the solution became clear. We eliminated 45,000 excess units. Not because I knew more about automotive than the automotive experts, but because I was looking at it sideways.

## What I Do

I work with companies that have problems worth solving. Usually technical challenges that sit at the intersection of data, business logic, and human behavior. 

Currently serving as Acting CTO across multiple Fortune 500 accounts while mentoring a team of 25+ professionals. The work spans predictive analytics, system optimization, and strategic planning.

My background is mechanical engineering and applied mathematics. Turns out, the analytical frameworks that work for understanding physical systems often apply beautifully to business systems.

## The Mathematical Mindset

Pattern recognition across domains. Root cause analysis. Elegant solutions over brute force approaches.

When you've solved similar problems in healthcare, the path through retail becomes visible. When you understand the mathematics of one optimization challenge, you start seeing the same structures everywhere.

It's not about being the smartest person in the room. It's about being the person who's seen this pattern before, just wearing different clothes.
