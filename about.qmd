## The AI Architect

14 years. 6 industries. One insight that changes everything.

::: {.section}

## The Origin Story

I didn't set out to become "The AI Architect."

I started as a mechanical engineer with a background in applied mathematics. Early in my career, I was hired to solve automotive inventory problems that traditional approaches couldn't crack.

The patterns were too complex. The variables too numerous. The standard playbooks weren't working.

**Then I had a realization:**

What if I stopped thinking about this like an automotive problem and started thinking about it like a healthcare system managing patient flow?

Suddenly, the solution became obvious. We eliminated 45,000 excess units.

Not because I knew more about automotive than the automotive experts.

**Because I was looking at it sideways.**

## The Pattern Emerges

Over 14 years across automotive, retail, insurance, FMCG, and telecommunications, I kept seeing the same thing:

**The breakthrough comes from applying insights from completely different domains.**

Healthcare solving automotive. Retail transforming manufacturing. Mathematical frameworks from physics applied to business systems.

Most experts stay within their industry expertise. They know their domain deeply, but they're looking straight ahead.

I learned to look sideways.

## The Mathematical Mindset

In mathematics, there's never just one solution to a problem. Some roots are simply more beautiful than others.

This philosophy drives how I approach enterprise AI:

- **Pattern recognition across domains** instead of single-industry expertise
- **Root cause analysis** instead of surface-level fixes
- **Elegant solutions** over brute force approaches
- **Systemic thinking** instead of point solutions

When you've solved similar problems in healthcare, the path through retail becomes visible. When you understand the mathematics of one optimization challenge, you start seeing the same structures everywhere.

## Current Work

I serve as Acting CTO across multiple Fortune 500 accounts while mentoring a team of 25+ professionals.

The work spans:

- Predictive analytics and AI strategy architecture
- Cross-industry system optimization
- Executive team transformation and strategic planning
- Implementation frameworks that actually scale

I also run **The AI Architect Protocol** — a 3-day intensive that teaches enterprise leaders to think like architects instead of tool users.

## The Framework

After years of cross-industry work, I've distilled the approach into repeatable systems:

**The OLCD Protocol:** Observe → Learn → Create → Deploy

**The AI-ART Matrix:** A diagnostic framework that reveals why 73% of enterprise AI initiatives fail to scale

**The Blueprint Methodology:** Architecture-first thinking for AI transformation

These aren't theoretical models. They're battle-tested frameworks deployed across six industries.

## Beyond the Work

When I'm not architecting AI systems, you'll find me:

- Playing guitar (badly but enthusiastically)
- Planning the next off-the-beaten-path adventure
- Reading mathematical proofs for fun (yes, really)

Getting lost in unfamiliar places keeps the mind flexible. Some of my best insights come from being completely outside my comfort zone.

## Want to Work Together?

I take on a limited number of consulting engagements and run cohort-based training for enterprise AI leaders.
