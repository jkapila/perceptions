# The AI Architect Protocol

Don't just learn AI. Install the Operating System.

A 3-day intensive that transforms how you think about enterprise AI strategy.

::: {.section}

## The Problem

You've been to the conferences. Read the whitepapers. Attended the vendor demos.

But when it's time to actually implement AI at scale, the frameworks fall apart.

**Why?**

Because most AI training teaches you to think like a tool user. Not like an architect.

The AI Architect Protocol rewires your approach from the ground up.

### Day 2: Learn
Master the frameworks. OLCD Protocol, AI-ART Matrix, and the Architecture Blueprint. Understand how to think systematically about AI transformation instead of project-by-project.
:::

::: {.timeline-item}
### Day 3: Create
Build your 90-day AI transformation roadmap. Leave with a deployable strategy, not theoretical concepts. Apply pattern recognition across industries to solve your specific challenges.
