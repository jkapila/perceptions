    "text": "Cluster analysis has always fascinated me as a window into the hidden structures of data. During my collaboration with Kumarjit Pathak, we grappled with a persistent challenge in unsupervised learning: how to objectively evaluate clustering quality across different algorithms. Traditional metrics like the Silhouette Index or Bayesian Information Criterion felt restrictive—they were siloed within specific methodologies, making cross-algorithm comparisons unreliable.\nThis frustration led us to develop a universal cluster evaluation metric, detailed in our paper “Cross Comparison of Results from Different Clustering Approaches”. Our goal was to create a framework that transcends algorithmic biases, enabling:\n- Direct comparison of K-Means vs GMM vs DBSCAN vs PAM vs SOM vs Anything results\n- Identification of variables muddying cluster separation\n- Automated determination of optimal cluster counts\nIn this blog, I’ll walk you through our journey—from conceptualization to real-world validation—and share insights that didn’t make it into the final paper."

    "text": "Our “Aha!” Moment - Crosstab Sparsity\n\n\n\n\nBest Cluster for K-means Using Crosstab sparsity\n\n\n\nWhile analyzing cross-tab matrices of variable distributions across clusters, we noticed a pattern: well-segregated clusters consistently showed higher frequencies along matrix diagonals. This inspired our two-part metric:\n\n\n\nSegregation Factor:\n# Simplified calculation from our codebase  \nmedian = np.median(cross_tab)  \nN_vk = np.sum(cross_tab &gt; median)  # Count \"well-segregated\" instances  \nExplanation Factor:\nexplanation = np.log(len(data) / (bins * clusters))  \n\n\nSegregation Factor: Measures how distinctly clusters separate data points. We used the median (not mean) to avoid skew from outlier-dominated matrices.\nExplanation Factor: Quantifies how well clusters capture data variability. The logarithmic term penalizes overfitting—a critical insight from debugging early over-segmented clusters.\n\nAnd the Final Formula:\nFor variable \\(v\\) with \\(k\\) clusters:\n\\[\nS_v^k = \\underbrace{\\frac{N_v^k}{\\max(l, k)}}_{\\text{Segregation}} \\times \\underbrace{\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_d}{l \\times k}\\right)}_{\\text{Explanation}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(N_v^k\\): Segregated instances (values above cross-tab matrix median)\n- \\(l\\): Number of value intervals for variable \\(v\\)\n- \\(N_d\\): Total observations\nThis formulation ensures algorithmic invariance, allowing comparison across methods like K-Means (distance-based) and GMM (probability-based). Also, now you can see from the formula two scenarios happens: 1. If each variable crosstab is too dense then their is no separation between classes 2. If each variable crosstab is too sparse then we loose on explanation.\nHence the curve reaches a maximum and then falls down giving use the separability that the cluster can produce:"

Lets dive in.\nThere are different value estimation technique like regression analysis and time-series analysis. Everyone of us has experimented on regression using OLS ,MLE, Ridge, LASSO, Robust etc., and also might have evaluated them using RMSE (Root Mean/Median Square Error), MAD (Mean/Median Absolute Deviation), MAE (Mean / Median Absolute Error) and MAPE (Mean/Median Absolute Percentage Error), etc…\nBut all of these gives a single point estimate that what is the overall error looks like. Just a different thought!! can we be sure that this single value of MAPE or MAE? How easy it is to infer that our trained model has fitted well across the distribution of dependent variable?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot of Anscombe’s Quartet\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Descriptive Stats for Anscombe’s Quartet\n\n\nLet me give you a pretty small data-set to play with “The Anscombe’s quartet”. This is a very famous data-set by Francis Anscombe. Please refer the plots below to understand the distribution of y1, y2, y3, y4. Isn’t it different?\nWould the measure of central tendency and disportion be same for this data? I am sure none of us would believe but to our utter surprise we see all the descriptive stats are kind of same. Don’t believe me !!! Please see the results below ( Source: Wikipedia ):"

Let us show you what we see that pattern. One day while working on a business problem where I was using regression on a discussion with Kumarjit, we deviced a different way of model diagnosis. We worked together to give this a shape and build on it.\n\nAs you can see it is absolutely evident that either of the side in the distribution of MAPE values is going wild!!!!!!!

In our experiments when we replace failure with MAPE value and the Time with sorted (ascending) value of target / dependent variable, we observe the same phenomenon. This is likely to happen because most of regression techniques assumes Normal (Gaussian) Distribution of data and fits itself towards the central tendency of this distribution.\nBecause of this tendency, any regression methods tends to learn less about data which are away from the central tendency of the target.\nLets look at BostonHousing data from “mlbench” package in R.\n\n\n\nPlot for MAPE Bath Tub Curve for Decile Split “mdev” from Data\n\n\nHere the MAPE is calculated for each decile split of ordered target variable. As you can observe it is following the bath tub curve. Hence the validates our hypothesis that the regression method is not able to understand much about the data at the either ends of the distribution."

And then weeks later the obvious question appears: “Okay — what decision does this support?” People shrug. The project stalls. The models are good. The business impact is vague.\nThis is the dataset-first trap. It wastes time, money, and faith. It also gives AI a bad name.\nI’ve seen the opposite work — a lot. Start with the decision. Map the decision. Then pick the simplest data and model that make the decision better. The result? Faster pilots, clearer ROI, and systems that actually get used.\nThat approach is not just a management neat-idea. There’s a real body of research showing that aligning models to downstream decision goals yields better decisions than optimizing prediction accuracy alone.

The demo gets applause. Then the work hits integration, governance, and the messy reality of people who must make decisions every day. The model’s outputs don’t map to a decision process. So adoption fails.\n\nWhy? Because the project optimized the wrong thing. It optimized prediction metrics — error, F1, AUC, MAPE. And those are useful. But they’re not the measure of business impact. A model with better accuracy can still be useless if it doesn’t change what someone does.\nHarvard Business Review captured this idea well: decisions don’t start with data. They start with a problem, a role, a process, and a behavior. If your analytics don’t connect to that reality, you get slides and disappointment. Harvard Business Review\nThere are more subtle costs too. Dataset-first projects often create models that are brittle in production: they overfit to historical quirks, they require constant data wrangling, and they produce numbers no one trusts.

When you optimize directly for the decision loss, you often get better business outcomes — even with “worse” prediction metrics. arXiv+1\nRecent papers and reviews show both the theory and practical methods: surrogate losses that reflect decision outcomes, techniques to differentiate through optimization, and heuristics for discrete problems.

    "text": "The Decision Map: simple framework you can use today\nIf you want to flip to decision-first, start with a small, disciplined tool I call a Decision Map. It’s a one-page artefact. Build it before you touch data.\nHere’s the Decision Map — six steps. Do them in order.\n\nName the decision. Who decides, how often, and what options do they choose? Example: “Field-ops decides whether to dispatch a technician to a suspected DSL fault.” Be specific. Frequency matters — hourly, daily, weekly change what you can do.\nDefine the decision metric(s).What counts as success? Lower cost? Faster response time? Increase in net revenue? Pick one primary metric and one secondary. If you can’t name it in a single measurable sentence, you don’t have a decision.\nMap the current process. Where is the decision made today? Which people and tools are involved? Where does data enter? Where do delays happen? This step exposes the friction you must remove.\nIdentify the minimal action the model must trigger. The model doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to change behavior. If the model’s output is a probability, what threshold triggers action? Who gets the alert? What’s the handoff?\nList the minimal signals (data) needed. Only include data that directly reduces uncertainty for the decision. You’ll be surprised how small this list often is. Think: signal → action. Not “all the data.”\nPlan the feedback loop. How will you measure the decision metric after deployment? How will you collect labels and iterate? Decide that upfront.\n\nIf you complete this map, you’ll have done 80% of the work most teams skip. It forces alignment, and it reveals whether the project is worth doing."

    "text": "A telecom example, mapped end-to-end (real story)\nA brief, real example matters. I built a real-time anomaly detection system for a European telecom client early in my career. The project didn’t begin with “we have logs.” It began with this decision map:\n\nDecision: Should operations dispatch a field technician proactively for a suspected DSL fault?\nMetric: Reduce customer reported faults and improve Net Promoter Score (NPS) by reducing time-to-detect. Also: monthly cost savings from fewer reactive truck rolls and more planned truck rolls.\nProcess: Operations received the customer call, created a ticket, and dispatched if needed — often hours or days later. That was slow and expensive.\n\nAction: If the system flags an anomaly with high confidence\nRed : Very high probability in next 48 hours,\nAmber: probability in next 2-15 days\nGreen: No visibility of error in next 15 days This creates a high-priority ticket and dispatch a remote check or technician and was planned in region wise manner.\n\nSignals: DSL line metrics, error rates, device telemetry, event logs — a handful of streams, not every log.\nFeedback: Compare flagged incidents to customer complaints and adjust thresholds.\n\nBecause the decision was so clear, we could measure value before full scale. The pilot cut detection time from days to hours, raised customer satisfaction significantly ( We sent messages to possible signal disruption early), and saved ~£80K per month ( because reducing complete breakdown to DSL by heat or so and by planning the route than going everywhere) . It wasn’t an exotic model (or may be it was, tech details some other day); it was a tightly scoped system that informed a clear action.\nNotice how this maps to the Decision-First steps. The model existed to change a single operational choice. That focus made deployment possible and measurable fast."

    "section": "Another quick example: inventory decisions",
    "text": "Another quick example: inventory decisions\nInventory forecasting is a classic area where decision-first matters. You can chase lower MAPE and never change stocking policy. Or you can ask: what decision do merchandisers make with this forecast? When you frame it as “which SKUs do we order for next week, and what reorder points trigger expedited shipments,” you design the forecast differently: shorter horizons, bias for understock on fast movers, and direct constraints on reorder costs.\nI’ve led projects that delivered $11M in inventory optimization by building forecasts and decision rules that match merchant behavior and supply constraints. The trick was not better models — it was framing forecasts so the merchandisers could act with confidence."

    "text": "Practical tips for teams (do this in week one)\n\nRun a one-hour Decision Map workshop. Invite the decision owner, one operator, one engineer, and one product owner. Build the one-page map. If the owner can’t commit to a metric, pause the project.\nStart with a simple rule baseline. Before modeling, define a rule that will be your baseline (e.g., “if X &gt; T, create ticket”). If the model can’t beat that rule in decision impact, scrap it.\nMeasure decision impact, not model accuracy. Your dashboard should show business metric delta — not just RMSE. If you show the board a change in cost or conversion, you’ll get attention.\nPrioritize deployment constraints. Decide telemetry, latency, and handoff requirements first. Models that can’t meet latency or trust constraints are useless no matter how accurate.\nIterate with real feedback. Don’t wait for “perfect.” Ship an MVP that can be measured, then refine. Real decisions provide labels and operational learning."

    "text": "Common objections and how to handle them\n“But we don’t have a clear decision owner.” Then don’t build a model. Decisions live in roles. Pull the right owner in early, or you’ll build for nobody.\n“Our data is messy.” Fine. If you can define the minimal signals, you can often create a proxy or start with manual labels. Messy data is easier to handle when you only need a few signals for a specific decision.\n“We need predictions for many uses.” Build a simple decision-first pilot first. Use its success to fund broader platform work. Pilots create proof that unlocks investment.\n“Decision-focused methods are academic — too hard.” There’s truth and myth here. The academic techniques show big wins when decision loss can be written down. But you don’t need complicated differentiable optimization to start. Use a decision map, simple thresholds, A/B tests, and iterative measurement. Graduate to decision-focused training once you have a stable objective. The research just tells us — unsurprisingly — that when you train with the decision in mind, outcomes improve. Optimization Online+1"

If you're tired of vendor pitches and need actionable frameworks, this is for you.\n\n**What's the time commitment?**\n3 full days of intensive training (9 AM - 5 PM). Plus pre-work (2 hours) and post-bootcamp office hours (optional).\n\n**Is this technical or strategic?**\nBoth. You'll learn the architecture behind AI systems and the strategic frameworks to guide implementation. Not coding-heavy, but not theory-only either.\n\n**What's the ROI?**\nClients have documented $11M+ savings from applying these frameworks. The typical engagement prevents months of wasted AI experimentation.\n\n**Can I bring my team?**\nTeam discounts available for 3+ seats. Email jitin@jitinkapila.com for group pricing.\n\n**Is this recorded?**\nYes. Lifetime access to recordings, framework templates, and community updates included.\n\n:::\nAdd to consulting.qmd:\n::: {.section}\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**What industries do you serve?**\nFortune 500 clients across automotive, retail, insurance, FMCG, telecommunications, and healthcare. The cross-industry approach is the advantage.\n\n**What's your engagement model?**\nTypically 6-12 months embedded as Acting CTO or Strategic AI Advisor. Not project-based consulting—transformation partnerships.\n\n**How is this different from other AI consultants?**\nI bring solutions from completely different industries. Healthcare insights solving automotive problems. Retail strategies transforming manufacturing. Most consultants stay in their lane.\n\n**What's the investment range?**\nCustom scoped based on organization size and transformation goals. ROI is typically 10-50x documented savings within the first year.\n\n**Do you work remotely or on-site?**\nBoth. Initial strategy workshops are often on-site. Ongoing work is hybrid based on team needs.\n\n**What's the current waitlist?**\nQ2 2025 for new engagements.

If you're tired of vendor pitches and need actionable frameworks, this is for you.\n\n**What's the time commitment?**\n3 full days of intensive training (9 AM - 5 PM). Plus pre-work (2 hours) and post-bootcamp office hours (optional).\n\n**Is this technical or strategic?**\nBoth. You'll learn the architecture behind AI systems and the strategic frameworks to guide implementation. Not coding-heavy, but not theory-only either.\n\n**What's the ROI?**\nClients have documented $11M+ savings from applying these frameworks. The typical engagement prevents months of wasted AI experimentation.\n\n**Can I bring my team?**\nTeam discounts available for 3+ seats. Email jitin@jitinkapila.com for group pricing.\n\n**Is this recorded?**\nYes. Lifetime access to recordings, framework templates, and community updates included.\n\n:::\nAdd to consulting.qmd:\n::: {.section}\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**What industries do you serve?**\nFortune 500 clients across automotive, retail, insurance, FMCG, telecommunications, and healthcare. The cross-industry approach is the advantage.\n\n**What's your engagement model?**\nTypically 6-12 months embedded as Acting CTO or Strategic AI Advisor. Not project-based consulting—transformation partnerships.\n\n**How is this different from other AI consultants?**\nI bring solutions from completely different industries. Healthcare insights solving automotive problems. Retail strategies transforming manufacturing. Most consultants stay in their lane.\n\n**What's the investment range?**\nCustom scoped based on organization size and transformation goals. ROI is typically 10-50x documented savings within the first year.\n\n**Do you work remotely or on-site?**\nBoth. Initial strategy workshops are often on-site. Ongoing work is hybrid based on team needs.\n\n**What's the current waitlist?**\nQ2 2025 for new engagements.

The standard playbooks weren’t working.\nThen I had a realization:\nWhat if I stopped thinking about this like an automotive problem and started thinking about it like a healthcare system managing patient flow?\nSuddenly, the solution became obvious. We eliminated 45,000 excess units.\nNot because I knew more about automotive than the automotive experts.\nBecause I was looking at it sideways."

You’re leading teams of 50+ people. You’re making decisions that move markets.\nBut you’re still doing manual data entry.\nMeanwhile, a 22-year-old with ChatGPT is doing your job faster.\nThe gap is widening.\nSenior professionals are being replaced by efficient systems. Not because they lack expertise. Because they lack operational leverage.\nStop watching. Start building.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re a senior professional (10+ years experience) managing significant portfolios or P&L\n\nYou’re drowning in repetitive work that AI could handle, but don’t know where to start\n\nYou’re afraid of obsolescence as younger, AI-fluent professionals move faster\n\nYou’ve tried ChatGPT but can’t scale it beyond simple tasks into real operational leverage\n\nYou manage teams and need to 10x their output without 10x-ing headcount\n\nYou’re willing to invest 3 days to build a system that saves 10+ hours every week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re new to your field (less than 5 years experience)\nYou want to “learn AI” for your resume without implementing anything\nYou’re looking for passive income schemes or get-rich-quick tactics\nYou expect AI to do 100% of your job (it won’t)\nYou’re not willing to invest 2-3 hours per week maintaining your AI systems\nYou want theory and certifications, not practical operational systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Context: A regional grocery chain with ₹50Cr annual revenue, operating 15 stores across 3 cities.\nThe “Before” (Ambiguity & Pain): - Lost 15% of inventory to spoilage (₹7.5Cr annual loss) - Manual ordering took 20 hours per week across all stores - No predictive capability - constantly over-ordering perishables - Supply chain decisions based on “gut feel” from 30-year veterans\nThe AI-ART Intervention: We installed a Predictive Ordering Agent using simple Excel + OpenAI API (no coding, no data scientists, no million-dollar platforms).\nThe system: - Analyzed 3 years of sales data (already sitting in Excel) - Factored in weather patterns, local events, seasonality - Generated daily ordering recommendations per store - Learned from feedback (what sold, what spoiled)\nThe “After” (ROI): - Spoilage reduced by 92% (saving ₹6.9Cr annually) - Ordering time reduced from 20 hours/week to 2 hours/week - Profit margins increased by ₹8.2Cr in first year - Total investment: ₹45,000 (including our training)\nROI: 182x in Year 1.\n\nThis isn’t a unicorn story. This is what happens when senior professionals apply operational AI thinking to their existing expertise.\nYou don’t need a PhD. You need a system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpending 20+ hours/week on repetitive analysis\nDrowning in emails, reports, data entry\nCan’t scale yourself without hiring more people\nWatching younger professionals move faster with AI\nScared of being replaced by automation\nUsing ChatGPT for one-off tasks with no system\nNo operational leverage beyond your own hours\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Profit OS handles 40% of repetitive workflow\nEmail processing, report generation, data analysis automated\n10x team output without 10x headcount\nYou’re the AI-fluent leader others come to\nYou’re building the systems, not being replaced by them\nDeep-Research Prompt System producing insights in minutes\nOperational leverage: Your decisions scale 24/7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning: The AI Maturity Assessment - Map your current workflow: Where are you spending 80% of your time? - Identify automation opportunities using the OLCD diagnostic framework - Calculate your “time ROI” - what’s actually worth automating first? - Build your personalized 90-day AI implementation roadmap\nAfternoon: Quick Wins Workshop - Install your first AI agent (email processing or report generation) - See immediate time savings (2-5 hours/week from Day 1) - Understand the “AI-ART Matrix” - why most AI projects fail to scale - Learn the “Grocery Store Framework” - how to think about AI operationally\nDeliverable: Your 90-Day AI Roadmap + First AI agent deployed\n\n\n\nMorning: The Research Multiplier - Build your Deep-Research Prompt System (the Excel-based framework) - How to extract insights from data you already have - Pattern recognition across your domain (using AI to spot trends you’d miss) - Case study: How I saved ₹6.9Cr for the grocery chain using this system\nAfternoon: The Data Asset Library - Create your personal “Data Asset Library” template - Learn to structure your knowledge for AI consumption - Build your “Second Brain” that actually works (not just another note-taking system) - How to train AI on your specific domain expertise\nDeliverable: Deep-Research Prompt System + Data Asset Library template\n\n\n\nMorning: AI Governance Playbooks - How to ensure AI output quality (avoid garbage-in-garbage-out) - Build review systems that catch AI mistakes before they matter - Team training: How to get your team using AI without breaking things - The “Human-in-the-Loop” framework for high-stakes decisions\nAfternoon: Your Custom ROI Calculator - Build your AI ROI calculator (track time saved, output increased, revenue impact) - Measure what matters: Operational leverage, not vanity metrics - The “10-Hour Rule” - how to save minimum 10 hours/week with AI - Final Q&A: Troubleshooting your specific implementation challenges\nDeliverable: AI Governance Playbook + Custom ROI Calculator + Complete AI Profit OS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJitin Kapila\n\n\nEx-Fortune 500 AI Lead. Managed $80M+ Portfolios.\nI don’t teach theory. I build enterprise-grade systems.\nJitin Kapila has deployed AI systems across Mercedes Benz, L’Oréal, Maruti Suzuki, British Telecom, and 8+ other Fortune 500 enterprises.\nBackground: - 14+ years architecting AI solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises - Managed portfolios exceeding $80M across automotive, retail, FMCG, telecommunications - Mechanical Engineering + Applied Mathematics background - Not a career educator - a practitioner who teaches\nTrack Record: - ₹6.9Cr annual savings (grocery chain spoilage reduction) - $11M operational optimization (automotive inventory system) - £80K/month revenue lift (retail predictive forecasting) - 45,000-unit inventory reduction (supply chain optimization)\nPhilosophy: Senior professionals don’t need more theory. They need operational systems that create leverage. The AI Profit OS isn’t a course - it’s a toolkit you’ll use every day for the next decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I had the pleasure of working with Jitin for over two years (2023–2025) on a high-intensity AI program that was both technically complex and highly impactful for the business. Jitin played a pivotal role not only in experimenting with and developing the AI-driven forecasting solution but also in serving as an AI coach for end users, helping them understand and trust the forecasts produced by the model(s).\nHis deep data science expertise, combined with his ability to translate technical concepts into clear business language, made a remarkable difference in co-creating a truly futuristic AI product.”\n— Nikhil Jain, Head of Tech Accelerator & AI Innovation Client engagement: 2023-2025\n\n\n“Jitin has the profound expertise of advanced level of R and Python. Many people at Harman Connected Services find his enthusiasm and dedication both inspiring and motivating. He showed a high level of command on Data Science, Machine Learning techniques and was a valuable contributor to our projects. He learns quickly and I would have no hesitation in working with Jitin once again in the future.”\n— Aasheesh Barvey, Data-Informed Decision-Making & Advanced Analytics Senior Manager, Strategy & Project Management\n\n\n“Jitin Kapila is a transformed data scientist with huge enthusiasm to learn new things. I have seen him growing from level to level in data science. Clarity of thoughts and out of the box thinking comes naturally to him.\nHe is a master class coding hand and can decompose any hard problem into simple logic and quickly build a scalable and ready to implement solution. I would like to have him any day any time working with me.”\n— Kumarjit Pathak, Global AI & Data Science Leader @ ABInBev Daniel H. Wagner Prize Winner (INFORMS 2022) | Visionary Innovator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Full Days of Live Training Interactive sessions with direct access to 14+ years of Fortune 500 AI implementation experience Value: ₹75,000\n\n\nYour 90-Day AI Roadmap Personalized implementation plan - start saving time from Week 1 Value: ₹50,000\n\n\nDeep-Research Prompt System (Excel-Based) The same framework that saved ₹6.9Cr for the grocery chain Value: ₹40,000\n\n\nData Asset Library Template Structure your expertise for AI consumption - build your “Second Brain” Value: ₹25,000\n\n\nAI Governance Playbooks Quality control systems for high-stakes AI decisions Value: ₹30,000\n\n\nCustom ROI Calculator Track time saved, output increased, revenue impact - measure what matters Value: ₹20,000\n\n\nLifetime Recording Access All sessions recorded, plus framework updates as systems evolve Value: ₹15,000\n\n\nPrivate Community Access Ongoing support with fellow AI Profit OS users, monthly office hours with Jitin Value: ₹25,000\n\n\nTotal Value: ₹2,80,000 Founding Cohort Investment: ₹4,999 (Saves ₹2,75,001) Regular Price: ₹15,999 (after founding cohort closes)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t save at least 10 hours of work per week using the AI Profit OS within 30 days, I will refund you and pay you ₹5,000 for wasting your time.\nYes, you read that right.\nRefund + ₹5,000 penalty paid to you.\nWhy am I this confident? Because the system works. The grocery chain saved ₹6.9Cr. The automotive client saved $11M. The retail client generates £80K/month additional revenue.\nIf you implement the frameworks and don’t save minimum 10 hours per week, I’ve failed you - and I’ll pay for it.\nTo claim: Email me within 30 days with (a) your 90-day roadmap, (b) evidence of implementation, (c) time tracking showing &lt;10 hours saved. If you did the work and didn’t get results, you get refund + ₹5,000.\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to know how to code?\nNo. The AI Profit OS is designed for senior professionals, not engineers. Everything is built in Excel + simple tools you already use. If you can use Google Sheets, you can build these systems.\n\n\nI’m not technical. Will I be able to follow?\nAbsolutely. This training is designed for business leaders, not data scientists. I’ve trained CFOs, COOs, and Senior Directors with zero technical background. If you can manage a P&L, you can operationalize AI.\n\n\nWhat if I can’t attend all 3 days live?\nYou’ll get lifetime recording access. However, the live workshops where you build YOUR specific systems are where the real value comes from. We strongly recommend attending live.\n\n\nIs this just ChatGPT training?\nNo. ChatGPT is one tool in the AI Profit OS, but the system is much bigger. You’ll learn: (a) How to structure your workflow for AI leverage, (b) How to build repeatable systems (not one-off prompts), (c) How to measure ROI and scale what works.\n\n\nWhat industries does this work for?\nIf you’re a senior professional doing knowledge work, this works. I’ve deployed AI systems across automotive, retail, FMCG, telecommunications, finance, and healthcare. The frameworks are industry-agnostic.\n\n\nWhat’s the refund policy?\nThe “Unheard Of” Guarantee (see above). If you implement the system and don’t save 10+ hours/week within 30 days, refund + ₹5,000 paid to you. After 30 days, no refunds - but you can transfer your seat to a colleague.\n\n\nCan I bring my team?\nYes! We offer team pricing for 3+ participants from the same organization. Email jitin@jitinkapila.com for custom team rates. (Recommended: Bring 2-3 key leaders to accelerate adoption.)\n\n\nHow is this different from other AI courses?\nMost AI courses teach theory or simple prompting.

This is what happens when senior professionals apply operational AI thinking to their existing expertise.\nYou don’t need a PhD. You need a system."

    "text": "Do I need to know how to code?\nNo. The AI Profit OS is designed for senior professionals, not engineers. Everything is built in Excel + simple tools you already use. If you can use Google Sheets, you can build these systems.\n\n\nI’m not technical. Will I be able to follow?\nAbsolutely. This training is designed for business leaders, not data scientists. I’ve trained CFOs, COOs, and Senior Directors with zero technical background. If you can manage a P&L, you can operationalize AI.\n\n\nWhat if I can’t attend all 3 days live?\nYou’ll get lifetime recording access. However, the live workshops where you build YOUR specific systems are where the real value comes from. We strongly recommend attending live.\n\n\nIs this just ChatGPT training?\nNo. ChatGPT is one tool in the AI Profit OS, but the system is much bigger. You’ll learn: (a) How to structure your workflow for AI leverage, (b) How to build repeatable systems (not one-off prompts), (c) How to measure ROI and scale what works.\n\n\nWhat industries does this work for?\nIf you’re a senior professional doing knowledge work, this works. I’ve deployed AI systems across automotive, retail, FMCG, telecommunications, finance, and healthcare. The frameworks are industry-agnostic.\n\n\nWhat’s the refund policy?\nThe “Unheard Of” Guarantee (see above). If you implement the system and don’t save 10+ hours/week within 30 days, refund + ₹5,000 paid to you. After 30 days, no refunds - but you can transfer your seat to a colleague.\n\n\nCan I bring my team?\nYes! We offer team pricing for 3+ participants from the same organization. Email jitin@jitinkapila.com for custom team rates. (Recommended: Bring 2-3 key leaders to accelerate adoption.)\n\n\nHow is this different from other AI courses?\nMost AI courses teach theory or simple prompting.

    "text": "Cross Roads where everyone meets!\n\n\n\nIntroduction: A Journey into Data\nPicture this: you’re standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, the wind whipping around you as you watch a colony of Palmer Penguins waddling about, oblivious to the data detective work you’re about to embark on. As a data science architect, you’re not just an observer; you’re a sleuth armed with algorithms and insights, ready to unravel the mysteries hidden within data. Today, we’ll transform raw numbers into powerful narratives using CrossTab Sparsity as our guiding compass. This blog post will demonstrate how this metric can revolutionize classification tasks, shedding light on many fascinating datasets—the charming Palmer Penguins and the serious Obesity, Credit cards data and many more.\n\n\nThe Power of CrossTab Sparsity\n\nWhat is CrossTab Sparsity?\nCrossTab Sparsity isn’t just a fancy term that sounds good at dinner parties; it’s a statistical measure that helps us peer into the intricate relationships between categorical variables. Imagine it as a magnifying glass that reveals how different categories interact within a contingency table. Understanding these interactions is crucial in classification tasks, where the right features can make or break your model (and your day).\nWhy Does It Matter?\nIn the world of data science, especially in classification, selecting relevant features is like picking the right ingredients for a gourmet meal—get it wrong, and you might end up with something unpalatable. CrossTab Sparsity helps us achieve this by:\n\nHighlighting Relationships: It’s like having a friend who always points out when two people are meant to be together—understanding how features interact with the target variable.\nStreamlining Models: Reducing complexity by focusing on significant features means less time spent untangling spaghetti code.\nEnhancing Interpretability: Making models easier to understand and explain to stakeholders is like translating tech jargon into plain English—everyone appreciates that!\n\n\n\n\nData Overview: Our Data People at work here\n\nThe Datasets\nData 1: Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition\nLittle bit about the data: This dataset, shared on 8/26/2019, looks at obesity levels in people from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia based on their eating habits and physical health. It includes 2,111 records with 16 features, and classifies individuals into different obesity levels, from insufficient weight to obesity type III. Most of the data (77%) was created using a tool, while the rest (23%) was collected directly from users online.\nData 2: Predict Students’ Dropout and Academic Success\nLittle bit about the data: This dataset, shared on 12/12/2021, looks at factors like students’ backgrounds, academic path, and socio-economic status to predict whether they’ll drop out or succeed in their studies. With 4,424 records across 36 features, it covers students from different undergrad programs. The goal is to use machine learning to spot at-risk students early, so schools can offer support. The data has been cleaned and doesn’t have any missing values. It’s a classification task with three outcomes: dropout, still enrolled, or graduated\nKey Features:\n\nMulticlass: Both data set cater a multi class problems with NObeyesdad and Target columns\nMixed Data Type: A good mix of categorical and continuous variables are available for usage.\nSizeable: More than 2 K rows are available for testing.\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Setting the Stage\nBefore we dive into model creation, let’s explore our dataset through some quick EDA.

This word EDA1 was coined by Tukey himself in his seminal book published in 1983. But do you think that before that EDA doesn’t existed ?\n1 Emerson, J. D., & Hoaglin, D. C. (1983). Stem-and-leaf displays. In D. C. Hoaglin, F. Mosteller, & J. W. Tukey (Eds.) Understanding Robust and Exploratory Data Analysis, pp. 7–32. New York: Wiley. Book is here.Well glad you thought. Before that all were doing what is called as Hypothesis Testing. Yes, before this the race was majorly to fit the data and make most unbiased and robust estimate. But remember one thing when you talk about Hypothesis Testing it was always and majorly would be related to RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) a.k.a Randomized Clinical Trials and is Gold Standard of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMore on RCTs and ODs\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let me now not hijack the discussion to what is RCTs and Observational Data (ODs) as it is more of Philosophical Reasoning rather than other quality of data, but essentially what we are trying to find is that can we by, using stats, identify interesting patterns in data.\nThe only thing happens wit RCT data is that we tend to believe these interesting patterns coincide with some sort of ‘Cause-Effect’ kind of relationship. But essentially due to bia nature of ODs, we certainly cant conclude this. And hence, can only find interesting patterns.\n\n\n\nLets move on. The big question is, for whatever reason you are doing HT , you are doing it for finding something intreating. And that something interesting is usually found by using Post-Hoc Tests. Now there are variety of Post-Hocs available but what is more know and hence easily found to be implemented in Tukey’s HSD.\nSo lets directly jump to how to follow this procedure. We’ll be using bioinfokit for this, as it is much simpler wrapper around whats implemented in statsmodels.\n\n\nWhat are the results\nPheww… Thats too much code right. But that would save a lot of your time in real life. So in real life you would write code as 3 steps below:\n\n\nCode\n# import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Getting car data from UCI\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data',\n                 sep='\\s+',header=None,\n                 names=['mpg','cylinders','displacement','horsepower','weight',\n                 'acceleration','model_year','origin','car_name'])\ndf.head()\n\n# Syntax to do anove with validating the assumption, doing test and a post-hoc\nresults = do_anova_test(df=df, res_var='mpg',xfac_var='cylinders', \n                        anova_model='mpg ~ C(cylinders)+C(origin)+C(cylinders):C(origin)',\n                        ss_typ=3, result_full=True)\n\n\nResults form the do_anova_test\nLevens Test Result:\n                 Parameter    Value\n0      Test statistics (W)  14.5856\n1  Degrees of freedom (Df)   4.0000\n2                  p value   0.0000\n\nBartletts Test Result:\n                 Parameter    Value\n0      Test statistics (T)  61.2143\n1  Degrees of freedom (Df)   4.0000\n2                  p value   0.0000\n\nANOVA\\ANCOVA Test Result:\n                           df     sum_sq    mean_sq         F  PR(&gt;F)      n2\nIntercept                 1.0  6195.1701  6195.1701  296.3452  0.0000  0.2727\nC(cylinders)              4.0  7574.5864  1893.6466   90.5824  0.0000  0.3334\nC(origin)                 2.0   241.0703   120.5351    5.7658  0.0034  0.0106\nC(cylinders):C(origin)    8.0   577.4821    72.1853    3.4530  0.0046  0.0254\nResidual                389.0  8132.1404    20.9052       NaN     NaN     NaN\n\nTukey HSD Result:\n   group1  group2     Diff    Lower    Upper  q-value  p-value\n0       8       4  14.3237  12.8090  15.8383  36.6527   0.0010\n1       8       6   5.0226   3.1804   6.8648  10.5671   0.0010\n2       8       3   5.5869  -0.7990  11.9728   3.3909   0.1183\n3       8       5  12.4036   5.0643  19.7428   6.5503   0.0010\n4       4       6   9.3011   7.6765  10.9256  22.1910   0.0010\n5       4       3   8.7368   2.4102  15.0633   5.3524   0.0017\n6       4       5   1.9201  -5.3676   9.2078   1.0212   0.9000\n7       6       3   0.5643  -5.8486   6.9772   0.3410   0.9000\n8       6       5   7.3810   0.0182  14.7437   3.8854   0.0491\n9       3       5   6.8167  -2.7539  16.3873   2.7606   0.2919\nNice!!!\n\nAnd plotting is even easier\n\n\nCode\n# Numbers are clumsy for most.

    "text": "The Allure and Limitation of KNN\nIn the realm of machine learning, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm stands out for its intuitive nature and ease of implementation. Its principle is simple: classify a data point based on the majority class among its ‘k’ nearest neighbors in the feature space. This non-parametric approach makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, rendering it versatile for various applications. KNN is very popular, but it comes with some limitations.\nHowever, KNN’s Achilles’ heel lies in its reliance on distance metrics, which are inherently designed for numerical data. Real-world datasets often contain a mix of numerical and categorical features, posing a significant challenge for KNN. How do you measure the distance between ‘red’ and ‘blue,’ or ‘large’ and ‘small’?\n\nPrior Art\nSeveral strategies have been proposed to adapt KNN for mixed data:\n\nOne-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical features into numerical vectors, but can lead to high dimensionality.\nDistance Functions for Mixed Data: Develops and apply custom distance metrics that can handle both numerical and categorical features such as HEOM and many others.\nUsing mean/mode values: Replace the missing values with mean/mode.\n\nThese methods often involve compromises, either distorting the data’s inherent structure or adding computational overhead."

    "text": "Enter TrieKNN: A Novel Approach\nWhat if we could cleverly sidestep the distance calculation problem for categorical features, while still leveraging KNN’s power? TrieKNN offers just that—a way to perform KNN on any mixed data!\nTrieKNN combines the strengths of Trie data structures and KNN to handle mixed data types gracefully. Here’s the core idea:\n\nTrie-Based Categorical Encoding: A Trie is used to store the categorical features of the data. Each node in the Trie represents a category.\nLeaf-Node KNN Models: At the leaf nodes of the Trie, where specific combinations of categorical features are found, we fit individual KNN models using only the numerical features.\nWeighted Prediction: To classify a new data point, we traverse the Trie based on its categorical features. At each level, we calculate a weighted distance based on available data, ending in a probability score in each leaf node.\n\n\nWhy This Works\n\nNo Direct Distance Calculation for Categorical Features: The Trie structure implicitly captures the relationships between categorical values.\nLocalized KNN Models: By fitting KNN models at the leaf nodes, we ensure that distance calculations are performed only on relevant numerical features.\nScalability: The Trie structure efficiently handles a large number of categorical features and values."
