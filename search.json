    "text": "The Allure and Limitation of KNN\nIn the realm of machine learning, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm stands out for its intuitive nature and ease of implementation. Its principle is simple: classify a data point based on the majority class among its ‘k’ nearest neighbors in the feature space. This non-parametric approach makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, rendering it versatile for various applications. KNN is very popular, but it comes with some limitations.\nHowever, KNN’s Achilles’ heel lies in its reliance on distance metrics, which are inherently designed for numerical data. Real-world datasets often contain a mix of numerical and categorical features, posing a significant challenge for KNN. How do you measure the distance between ‘red’ and ‘blue,’ or ‘large’ and ‘small’?\n\nPrior Art\nSeveral strategies have been proposed to adapt KNN for mixed data:\n\nOne-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical features into numerical vectors, but can lead to high dimensionality.\nDistance Functions for Mixed Data: Develops and apply custom distance metrics that can handle both numerical and categorical features such as HEOM and many others.\nUsing mean/mode values: Replace the missing values with mean/mode.\n\nThese methods often involve compromises, either distorting the data’s inherent structure or adding computational overhead."

    "text": "Enter TrieKNN: A Novel Approach\nWhat if we could cleverly sidestep the distance calculation problem for categorical features, while still leveraging KNN’s power? TrieKNN offers just that—a way to perform KNN on any mixed data!\nTrieKNN combines the strengths of Trie data structures and KNN to handle mixed data types gracefully. Here’s the core idea:\n\nTrie-Based Categorical Encoding: A Trie is used to store the categorical features of the data. Each node in the Trie represents a category.\nLeaf-Node KNN Models: At the leaf nodes of the Trie, where specific combinations of categorical features are found, we fit individual KNN models using only the numerical features.\nWeighted Prediction: To classify a new data point, we traverse the Trie based on its categorical features. At each level, we calculate a weighted distance based on available data, ending in a probability score in each leaf node.\n\n\nWhy This Works\n\nNo Direct Distance Calculation for Categorical Features: The Trie structure implicitly captures the relationships between categorical values.\nLocalized KNN Models: By fitting KNN models at the leaf nodes, we ensure that distance calculations are performed only on relevant numerical features.\nScalability: The Trie structure efficiently handles a large number of categorical features and values."

During my collaboration with Kumarjit Pathak, we grappled with a persistent challenge in unsupervised learning: how to objectively evaluate clustering quality across different algorithms. Traditional metrics like the Silhouette Index or Bayesian Information Criterion felt restrictive—they were siloed within specific methodologies, making cross-algorithm comparisons unreliable.\nThis frustration led us to develop a universal cluster evaluation metric, detailed in our paper “Cross Comparison of Results from Different Clustering Approaches”. Our goal was to create a framework that transcends algorithmic biases, enabling:\n- Direct comparison of K-Means vs GMM vs DBSCAN vs PAM vs SOM vs Anything results\n- Identification of variables muddying cluster separation\n- Automated determination of optimal cluster counts\nIn this blog, I’ll walk you through our journey—from conceptualization to real-world validation—and share insights that didn’t make it into the final paper."

    "text": "Our “Aha!” Moment - Crosstab Sparsity\n\n\n\n\nBest Cluster for K-means Using Crosstab sparsity\n\n\n\nWhile analyzing cross-tab matrices of variable distributions across clusters, we noticed a pattern: well-segregated clusters consistently showed higher frequencies along matrix diagonals. This inspired our two-part metric:\n\n\n\nSegregation Factor:\n# Simplified calculation from our codebase  \nmedian = np.median(cross_tab)  \nN_vk = np.sum(cross_tab &gt; median)  # Count \"well-segregated\" instances  \nExplanation Factor:\nexplanation = np.log(len(data) / (bins * clusters))  \n\n\nSegregation Factor: Measures how distinctly clusters separate data points. We used the median (not mean) to avoid skew from outlier-dominated matrices.\nExplanation Factor: Quantifies how well clusters capture data variability. The logarithmic term penalizes overfitting—a critical insight from debugging early over-segmented clusters.\n\nAnd the Final Formula:\nFor variable \\(v\\) with \\(k\\) clusters:\n\\[\nS_v^k = \\underbrace{\\frac{N_v^k}{\\max(l, k)}}_{\\text{Segregation}} \\times \\underbrace{\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_d}{l \\times k}\\right)}_{\\text{Explanation}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(N_v^k\\): Segregated instances (values above cross-tab matrix median)\n- \\(l\\): Number of value intervals for variable \\(v\\)\n- \\(N_d\\): Total observations\nThis formulation ensures algorithmic invariance, allowing comparison across methods like K-Means (distance-based) and GMM (probability-based). Also, now you can see from the formula two scenarios happens: 1. If each variable crosstab is too dense then their is no separation between classes 2. If each variable crosstab is too sparse then we loose on explanation.\nHence the curve reaches a maximum and then falls down giving use the separability that the cluster can produce:"

Everyone of us has experimented on regression using OLS ,MLE, Ridge, LASSO, Robust etc., and also might have evaluated them using RMSE (Root Mean/Median Square Error), MAD (Mean/Median Absolute Deviation), MAE (Mean / Median Absolute Error) and MAPE (Mean/Median Absolute Percentage Error), etc…\nBut all of these gives a single point estimate that what is the overall error looks like. Just a different thought!! can we be sure that this single value of MAPE or MAE? How easy it is to infer that our trained model has fitted well across the distribution of dependent variable?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot of Anscombe’s Quartet\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Descriptive Stats for Anscombe’s Quartet\n\n\nLet me give you a pretty small data-set to play with “The Anscombe’s quartet”. This is a very famous data-set by Francis Anscombe. Please refer the plots below to understand the distribution of y1, y2, y3, y4. Isn’t it different?\nWould the measure of central tendency and disportion be same for this data? I am sure none of us would believe but to our utter surprise we see all the descriptive stats are kind of same. Don’t believe me !!! Please see the results below ( Source: Wikipedia ):\n\n\nSo what we do Now!\nAstonished !!! Don’t be. This is what has been hiding behind those numbers. And this is why we really won’t be able to cross certain performance level. Unless you change some features or even do a lot of hyper parameter tuning, your results won’t vary much.\nIf you look at the average value of MAPE in each decile you would see an interesting pattern. Let us show you what we see that pattern. One day while working on a business problem where I was using regression on a discussion with Kumarjit, we deviced a different way of model diagnosis. We worked together to give this a shape and build on it.\n\nAs you can see it is absolutely evident that either of the side in the distribution of MAPE values is going wild!!!!!!! Still overall MAPE is good (18%).\n\n\n\nSeeking Scope of Improvement\nWe worked together to build a different framework to address such issues on the go and reduce the MAPE deterioration on the edge of the distribution.\nThis problems gives rise to a concept we named as Distribution Assertive Regression (DAR).\nDAR is a framework that is based on cancelling the weakness of one point summaries by using the classical concepts of Reliability Engineering : The Bath Tub Curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot for Classical Bath Tub Curve using a Hazard Function\n\n\nThe Specialty of this curve is that it gives you the likelihood which areas one tends to have high failure rates. In our experiments when we replace failure with MAPE value and the Time with sorted (ascending) value of target / dependent variable, we observe the same phenomenon. This is likely to happen because most of regression techniques assumes Normal (Gaussian) Distribution of data and fits itself towards the central tendency of this distribution.\nBecause of this tendency, any regression methods tends to learn less about data which are away from the central tendency of the target.\nLets look at BostonHousing data from “mlbench” package in R.\n\n\n\nPlot for MAPE Bath Tub Curve for Decile Split “mdev” from Data\n\n\nHere the MAPE is calculated for each decile split of ordered target variable. As you can observe it is following the bath tub curve. Hence the validates our hypothesis that the regression method is not able to understand much about the data at the either ends of the distribution.\n\n\nFinal Analysis\nNow the DAR framework essentially fixes this weakness of regression method and understands the behavior of data which is stable and can be tweak in a fashion that can be use in general practice.\nPlot of MAPE Bath Tub Curve after applying DAR Framework for Decile Split “mdev” from Data\n\nHow this framework with same method reduced MAPEs so much and made model much more stable…?? Well here it is:\nThe DAR framework splits the data at either ends of the order target variable and performs regression on these “split” data individually. This inherently reduces the so called “noise” part of the data and treat it as an individual data.\n\n\n\nScoring on New Data\nNow you might be thinking while applying regression this sounds good but how will one score this on new data. Well to answer that we used our most simple yet very effective friend “KNN” (Though any multiclass Classifier can be used here). So ideally scoring involves two step method :\n\nScore new value against each KNN / Multiclass Classifier model of the data\nBased on closeness we score it with the regression method used for that part of data.\n\nSo now we know how we can improve the prediction power of data for regression.\n\n\n\nCode and Flowchart\nIf things are simple lets keep it simple. Refer flowchart and code below for implementation of this framework. Paper here!\n\nR codePython codeHere is the Flow Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipClick to Expand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipClick to Expand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TB\n    \n    subgraph Testing\n        p1(Finding bucket of model to choose)\n        p1 --&gt; p2([Making predictions &lt;br&gt; based on selected model for inference])\n        p2 --&gt; p3(Consolidate final score of prediction)\n    end\n\n    subgraph Training\n        md([Fitting a &lt;br&gt;Regression model])==&gt; di\n        di{Binning Data via &lt;br/&gt; evaluating Distribution &lt;br/&gt; MAPE values }\n        di --&gt; md2([Fitting a Buckteing model &lt;br/&gt; to Binned MAPE Buckets])\n        md2 --&gt; md3([Fitting Regression &lt;br&gt; Models on Binned Data])\n        md == Keeping main&lt;br/&gt;model ==&gt; ro        \n        md3 ==&gt; ro(Final Models &lt;br&gt; Binning Data Models + &lt;br&gt; Set of Regressoin Models)\n    end\n\n    \n    od([Data Input]) -- Training&lt;br&gt; Data--&gt; md\n    od -- Testing&lt;br&gt; Data--&gt; p1\n    ro -.-&gt; p1\n    ro -.-&gt; p2\n\n    classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n    classDef yellow fill:#ff6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n    classDef blue fill:#00f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff;\n    classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\n    class md,md2,md3 green\n    class di orange\n    class p1,p2 yellow\n    class ro,p3 blue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "text": "Hypothesis testing Photo by Tara Winstead\n\n\n\nOverview\nAll the practitioners of data science always hit one giant thing to do with data and you know it well its EDA -Exploratory Data Analysis. This word EDA1 was coined by Tukey himself in his seminal book published in 1983. But do you think that before that EDA doesn’t existed ?\n1 Emerson, J. D., & Hoaglin, D. C. (1983). Stem-and-leaf displays. In D. C. Hoaglin, F. Mosteller, & J. W. Tukey (Eds.) Understanding Robust and Exploratory Data Analysis, pp. 7–32. New York: Wiley. Book is here.Well glad you thought. Before that all were doing what is called as Hypothesis Testing. Yes, before this the race was majorly to fit the data and make most unbiased and robust estimate. But remember one thing when you talk about Hypothesis Testing it was always and majorly would be related to RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) a.k.a Randomized Clinical Trials and is Gold Standard of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMore on RCTs and ODs\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let me now not hijack the discussion to what is RCTs and Observational Data (ODs) as it is more of Philosophical Reasoning rather than other quality of data, but essentially what we are trying to find is that can we by, using stats, identify interesting patterns in data.\nThe only thing happens wit RCT data is that we tend to believe these interesting patterns coincide with some sort of ‘Cause-Effect’ kind of relationship. But essentially due to bia nature of ODs, we certainly cant conclude this. And hence, can only find interesting patterns.\n\n\n\nLets move on. The big question is, for whatever reason you are doing HT , you are doing it for finding something intreating. And that something interesting is usually found by using Post-Hoc Tests. Now there are variety of Post-Hocs available but what is more know and hence easily found to be implemented in Tukey’s HSD.\nSo lets directly jump to how to follow this procedure. We’ll be using bioinfokit for this, as it is much simpler wrapper around whats implemented in statsmodels.\n\n\nWhat are the results\nPheww… Thats too much code right. But that would save a lot of your time in real life. So in real life you would write code as 3 steps below:\n\n\nCode\n# import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Getting car data from UCI\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data',\n                 sep='\\s+',header=None,\n                 names=['mpg','cylinders','displacement','horsepower','weight',\n                 'acceleration','model_year','origin','car_name'])\ndf.head()\n\n# Syntax to do anove with validating the assumption, doing test and a post-hoc\nresults = do_anova_test(df=df, res_var='mpg',xfac_var='cylinders', \n                        anova_model='mpg ~ C(cylinders)+C(origin)+C(cylinders):C(origin)',\n                        ss_typ=3, result_full=True)\n\n\nResults form the do_anova_test\nLevens Test Result:\n                 Parameter    Value\n0      Test statistics (W)  14.5856\n1  Degrees of freedom (Df)   4.0000\n2                  p value   0.0000\n\nBartletts Test Result:\n                 Parameter    Value\n0      Test statistics (T)  61.2143\n1  Degrees of freedom (Df)   4.0000\n2                  p value   0.0000\n\nANOVA\\ANCOVA Test Result:\n                           df     sum_sq    mean_sq         F  PR(&gt;F)      n2\nIntercept                 1.0  6195.1701  6195.1701  296.3452  0.0000  0.2727\nC(cylinders)              4.0  7574.5864  1893.6466   90.5824  0.0000  0.3334\nC(origin)                 2.0   241.0703   120.5351    5.7658  0.0034  0.0106\nC(cylinders):C(origin)    8.0   577.4821    72.1853    3.4530  0.0046  0.0254\nResidual                389.0  8132.1404    20.9052       NaN     NaN     NaN\n\nTukey HSD Result:\n   group1  group2     Diff    Lower    Upper  q-value  p-value\n0       8       4  14.3237  12.8090  15.8383  36.6527   0.0010\n1       8       6   5.0226   3.1804   6.8648  10.5671   0.0010\n2       8       3   5.5869  -0.7990  11.9728   3.3909   0.1183\n3       8       5  12.4036   5.0643  19.7428   6.5503   0.0010\n4       4       6   9.3011   7.6765  10.9256  22.1910   0.0010\n5       4       3   8.7368   2.4102  15.0633   5.3524   0.0017\n6       4       5   1.9201  -5.3676   9.2078   1.0212   0.9000\n7       6       3   0.5643  -5.8486   6.9772   0.3410   0.9000\n8       6       5   7.3810   0.0182  14.7437   3.8854   0.0491\n9       3       5   6.8167  -2.7539  16.3873   2.7606   0.2919\nNice!!!\n\nAnd plotting is even easier\n\n\nCode\n# Numbers are clumsy for most.

    "text": "Cross Roads where everyone meets!\n\n\n\nIntroduction: A Journey into Data\nPicture this: you’re standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, the wind whipping around you as you watch a colony of Palmer Penguins waddling about, oblivious to the data detective work you’re about to embark on. As a data science architect, you’re not just an observer; you’re a sleuth armed with algorithms and insights, ready to unravel the mysteries hidden within data. Today, we’ll transform raw numbers into powerful narratives using CrossTab Sparsity as our guiding compass. This blog post will demonstrate how this metric can revolutionize classification tasks, shedding light on many fascinating datasets—the charming Palmer Penguins and the serious Obesity, Credit cards data and many more.\n\n\nThe Power of CrossTab Sparsity\n\nWhat is CrossTab Sparsity?\nCrossTab Sparsity isn’t just a fancy term that sounds good at dinner parties; it’s a statistical measure that helps us peer into the intricate relationships between categorical variables. Imagine it as a magnifying glass that reveals how different categories interact within a contingency table. Understanding these interactions is crucial in classification tasks, where the right features can make or break your model (and your day).\nWhy Does It Matter?\nIn the world of data science, especially in classification, selecting relevant features is like picking the right ingredients for a gourmet meal—get it wrong, and you might end up with something unpalatable. CrossTab Sparsity helps us achieve this by:\n\nHighlighting Relationships: It’s like having a friend who always points out when two people are meant to be together—understanding how features interact with the target variable.\nStreamlining Models: Reducing complexity by focusing on significant features means less time spent untangling spaghetti code.\nEnhancing Interpretability: Making models easier to understand and explain to stakeholders is like translating tech jargon into plain English—everyone appreciates that!\n\n\n\n\nData Overview: Our Data People at work here\n\nThe Datasets\nData 1: Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition\nLittle bit about the data: This dataset, shared on 8/26/2019, looks at obesity levels in people from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia based on their eating habits and physical health. It includes 2,111 records with 16 features, and classifies individuals into different obesity levels, from insufficient weight to obesity type III. Most of the data (77%) was created using a tool, while the rest (23%) was collected directly from users online.\nData 2: Predict Students’ Dropout and Academic Success\nLittle bit about the data: This dataset, shared on 12/12/2021, looks at factors like students’ backgrounds, academic path, and socio-economic status to predict whether they’ll drop out or succeed in their studies. With 4,424 records across 36 features, it covers students from different undergrad programs. The goal is to use machine learning to spot at-risk students early, so schools can offer support. The data has been cleaned and doesn’t have any missing values. It’s a classification task with three outcomes: dropout, still enrolled, or graduated\nKey Features:\n\nMulticlass: Both data set cater a multi class problems with NObeyesdad and Target columns\nMixed Data Type: A good mix of categorical and continuous variables are available for usage.\nSizeable: More than 2 K rows are available for testing.\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Setting the Stage\nBefore we dive into model creation, let’s explore our dataset through some quick EDA.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Journey that challenges you are the best! Image by Devraj Bajgain\n\n\n\nMy Blogging Evolution: From Jekyll’s Depths to Quarto’s Data Science Peak\nThe realm of blogging platforms is expansive and constantly evolving, offering solutions for every niche. As a data science architect, my journey through this landscape has been a search for the ideal tool—one that integrates with my workflow, supports my use of R and Python, and enables me to share insights efficiently. This quest has led me from Jekyll to Hugo, and finally, to the data science-focused environment of Quarto. Let me recount this evolution.\n\nThe Beginning: Jekyll’s Promise and Problems\nAround 2015, Jekyll was a leading choice for static site generation. It promised a simple, static blog, but the reality had its challenges. The setup was relatively straightforward, but as a data scientist, I encountered significant drawbacks. My workflow involved R and Python code, and integrating these into blog posts was cumbersome. I spent more time tweaking Ruby and HTMLthan writing, which wasn’t ideal.\nIt was an inefficient process that stifled creativity. I needed a platform that understood the needs of data scientists, allowing seamless integration of code, narrative, and visuals. Despite its initial appeal, Jekyll proved more of a hindrance 😥\n\n\nA Glimmer of Hope: Hugo and Blogdown\nNext, I discovered Hugo, along with the blogdown package in R. This combination allowed me to write blog posts directly in R Markdown, which was revolutionary. I created shortcodes that suited my style, and writing in R Markdown was a game-changer.\nHowever, my enthusiasm was short-lived. As I shifted more towards Python for development, I faced the same old problem: juggling between environments. The dream of a unified workflow remained out of reach.\n\n\nThe Ideal: Quarto\nThen came Quarto. This has been transformative. Quarto is designed for researchers and data scientists, supporting both R and Python seamlessly. I started migrating my site in early 2022, and the transition was smooth. I built my site, deployed it on Netlify, and finally had a natural and intuitive workflow.\nQuarto allowed me to focus on content. I could write, code, and visualize without leaving my data science environment. Its support for multiple output formats made adapting content for different channels easy.\n\n\nThe Hiatus and the Return\nLife intervened, and blogging took a backseat during 2023 and early 2024.\nNow, I’m back. The goal is to blog better, creating content that sparks conversations and pushes data science communication. I aim to leverage Quarto’s full capabilities, building an engaging and informative blog, dashboards and whatever is possible. The plan is to distribute content across multiple channels and build a community. Fingers crossed, I won’t stop this time. ✌️\n\n\n\nLessons Learned and Resources\nMy blogging journey has taught me valuable lessons:\n\nChoose the Right Tool: The platform impacts your productivity. Select one that aligns with your workflow.\nEmbrace Simplicity: Focus on creating content and let the platform handle the rest.\nStay Consistent: Consistency is key. Maintain a realistic schedule.\nEngage with Your Audience: Interact with readers and build a community.\n\nMy recent inspiration is from :\n\n%&gt;% dreams Blog by Isabella Velásquez.\nNotes from a data witch A blog by Danielle Navarro.\nAlbert Rapp His personal Blog.\nRandom Realizations A great work by Matt Bowers especially for python users.\nBits of Analytics A good simple site!\nAwesome Quarto A great place to find best things on Quarto!!!\n\nTo enhance my blog, I’m referring to these resources:\n\nAster Hu’s experience migrating from Jekyll to Quarto\nRasmus Nes’s Blog on Hugo vs Quarto\nDiscussion on lightweight personal blogging platforms on Hacker News\nDan MacKinlay’s notes on static websites\nAnother Hacker News discussion on the best way to author blogs in 2024\nCan quarto work with Jekyll?\nSwesome Static Generators\n\nHere’s to the next phase of my blogging evolution. May it be filled with insights and innovation!\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Paper Link\n\n\nWe have lot of methods to access the global influence of a variable in data for most of ML Algorithms. But to make a justifiable point estimate about a datum might be a key source of information in many cases of Anomaly detection, Churn Analysis or Employee Attrition Reduction, etc.. Individual PIE values (point estimates) can be used to trigger a certain action. In this paper we estimate PIE values for Linear and Non Linear models.\n\n\nDistribution Assertive Regression (DAR). Paper Link and Blog Post\n\n\nDAR is regression analysis in which we understand how a fit of regression varies over it’s value. In this paper we resolve the Regression by Parts and estimate the new data based on heuristic methods like K-nearest Neighbor and Regression Equation."
