You’ll see how to ask the right questions about your own business.\n1 hour group breakout: You’ll work in small groups on a real use case. We’ll refine your thinking in real time.\n30 min Q&A: Ask me anything about your specific problems. We’ll help you think through them.\n\nBy end of Day 1: You’ll have evaluated 3–5 of your own business problems and ranked them by AI fit + strategic impact.\n\n\nDay 2: O.L.C.D Framework™ – Diagnostic Mapping\nWhat you’ll learn: How to map problems to actual AI use cases and understand what you’d need to execute.\nThe framework: O.L.C.D (Outcome, Logic, Capability, Data)\n\n1 hour teaching + practice: We walk through real client examples. You’ll see how different problems map to different AI solutions (some are ML, some are automation, some are pure workflow).\n1 hour group breakout: You’ll take your top use case from Day 1 and map it using O.L.C.D. We’ll uncover what data you have, what you’re missing, and what’s actually feasible.\n30 min Q&A: Get clarity on roadblocks, data gaps, or execution challenges.\n\nBy end of Day 2: You’ll have a diagnostic blueprint for your top 1–2 use cases (what to build, what data you need, who should own it).\n\n\nDay 3: ROI Mapping – Execution & Measurement\nWhat you’ll learn: How to quantify the business impact of your AI initiative and lock in stakeholder buy-in.\nThe methodology: Before/After ROI Model (time saved, cost reduced, revenue enabled, risk mitigated)\n\n1 hour teaching + practice: We walk through real ROI scenarios. You’ll see how to translate “saves time” into “saves ₹X” and how to build confidence intervals for your CFO.\n1 hour group breakout: You’ll build the ROI model for your top use case. What’s the before state? What’s the after state? What’s the timeline? What’s the investment required?\n1 hour Q&A + Roadmap finalization: We’ll lock in your 30–90 day execution plan. You’ll leave with a dated, accountable roadmap.\n\nBy end of Day 3: You’ll have a ROI-backed business case and a 90-day roadmap you can hand to your team or present to leadership."

It’s a thinking system.”\n\n— [VP of Operations, Fortune 500 Tech Company]\n\n\n“Every consultant we talked to quoted ₹100K+ and 6 months. The frameworks I learned here, I could apply immediately. I didn’t need to hire anyone. My team and I built the first use case in 8 weeks. This is a cheat code for non-technical leaders.”\n\n— [Chief Financial Officer, Mid-Market Services]\n\n\n“I was drowning in AI jargon. This cut through all of it. Instead of learning tools, I learned how to think about problems strategically. The ROI framework is what sold my leadership team.

    "section": "COMMON QUESTIONS",
    "text": "COMMON QUESTIONS\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to know how to code?\n\n\n\nNo. The AI Profit OS is designed for senior professionals, not engineers. Everything is built in Excel + simple tools you already use. If you can use Google Sheets, you can build these systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m not technical. Will I be able to follow?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely. This training is designed for business leaders, not data scientists. I’ve trained CFOs, COOs, and Senior Directors with zero technical background. If you can manage a P&L, you can operationalize AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I can’t attend all 3 days live?\n\n\n\nYou’ll get lifetime recording access. However, the live workshops where you build YOUR specific systems are where the real value comes from. We strongly recommend attending live.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this just ChatGPT training?\n\n\n\nNo. ChatGPT is one tool in the AI Profit OS, but the system is much bigger. You’ll learn: (a) How to structure your workflow for AI leverage, (b) How to build repeatable systems (not one-off prompts), (c) How to measure ROI and scale what works.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat industries does this work for?\n\n\n\nIf you’re a senior professional doing knowledge work, this works. I’ve deployed AI systems across automotive, retail, FMCG, telecommunications, finance, and healthcare. The frameworks are industry-agnostic.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the refund policy?\n\n\n\nThe “Unheard Of” Guarantee (see above). If you implement the system and don’t save 10+ hours/week within 30 days, refund + ₹5,000 paid to you. After 30 days, no refunds - but you can transfer your seat to a colleague.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I bring my team?\n\n\n\nYes! We offer team pricing for 3+ participants from the same organization. Email jitin@jitinkapila.com for custom team rates. (Recommended: Bring 2-3 key leaders to accelerate adoption.)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is this different from other AI courses?\n\n\n\nMost AI courses teach theory or simple prompting. The AI Profit OS is a complete operational system you’ll deploy in your workflow. You’re not learning about AI - you’re building leverage. By Day 3, you have working systems saving you time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if AI changes? Will this become outdated?\n\n\n\nThe OLCD Protocol, AI-ART Matrix, and operational frameworks are model-agnostic. Whether it’s ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever comes next, the system adapts. Plus, you get lifetime access to framework updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to be technical to do this?\n\n\n\nNo. This entire cohort is designed for non-technical people. You won’t code. You won’t write prompts. You’ll think strategically about where AI fits in your business and why.   The frameworks work whether you have a technical background or not. Your job is to architect. Your engineer’s job is to build.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I attend if I’m new to AI?\n\n\n\nYes, as long as you have 10+ years of professional experience. You don’t need to know what ChatGPT is or how transformers work. You need to understand your business, your problems, and what good execution looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I can’t attend live? Can I watch recordings?\n\n\n\nPartially. Recordings are available for 2 weeks post-cohort so you can catch up on lectures. But the breakout room work and live Q&A are the most valuable part—those happen during live sessions only.   If live attendance is an issue, reach out before you enroll. We can discuss options.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I bring my team?\n\n\n\nNo. This is designed for individual leaders. You become the AI strategist. You take this back to your team.   (If your team needs deep technical training on implementation, that’s a separate conversation—we have resources for that.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this just ChatGPT and prompts?\n\n\n\nNo. We don’t teach tools. We teach thinking. ChatGPT might be part of your solution, or it might not be. That depends on your use case.   What we do teach: How to think about problems strategically, how to evaluate which AI approaches fit, how to quantify ROI, and how to execute without hiring consultants.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens after the 3 days?\n\n\n\nYou get: * Access to our community (ask questions, peer learning) * 2x/month group sessions with me (forever) – we review your progress, refine strategy, unblock challenges * Email access (for urgent questions) You’re responsible for execution with your team. I’m your strategic advisor, not your implementer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if my AI implementation doesn’t work?\n\n\n\nThat’s not a refund trigger. The refund is if you can’t map a viable use case or create a roadmap.   If you map something and it doesn’t work in execution, that’s implementation, not strategy. In that case, you have 2x/month sessions to debug. We pivot and adjust.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is this different from other AI courses?\n\n\n\nMost courses teach you tools: Here’s ChatGPT. Here’s how to write prompts. Here’s how to use AI tools.   We teach you thinking: Here’s how to evaluate any problem. Here’s how to map it to a solution. Here’s how to quantify ROI so your CFO approves it.   Most courses are for beginners. This is for leaders who already understand business—you just need the AI framework.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this industry-agnostic?\n\n\n\nYes. AI is industry agnostic and we’ve worked with leaders in retail, finance, consulting, healthcare, tech, manufacturing, logistics. The frameworks work everywhere because they’re based on problems, not industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I implement something and it doesn’t hit the ROI I modeled?\n\n\n\nThat’s real life. Models are approximations. But here’s what matters: You’ll have a diagnostic framework. If results are worse than expected, you’ll know how to ask the right questions to debug it.   That’s what the 2x/month sessions are for.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I get a certificate?\n\n\n\nNo. Certificates are for validation. We focus on competence. After this cohort, you’ll be able to architect AI use cases for your business. That’s the real credential.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I decide this isn’t right for me after I enroll?\n\n\n\nYou have a 7-day money-back guarantee. If you enroll and change your mind, get a full refund within 7 days. No questions asked.   (The ROI guarantee kicks in after you complete the cohort, as detailed above.)."

    "text": "Start here: don’t open a notebook until you know the decision you want to change.\nSounds obvious. But most AI projects don’t start there. They start with a dataset, or with a “let’s try this model,” or with a platform demo that looks great in the cloud. And then weeks later the obvious question appears: “Okay — what decision does this support?” People shrug. The project stalls. The models are good. The business impact is vague.\nThis is the dataset-first trap. It wastes time, money, and faith. It also gives AI a bad name.\nI’ve seen the opposite work — a lot. Start with the decision. Map the decision. Then pick the simplest data and model that make the decision better. The result? Faster pilots, clearer ROI, and systems that actually get used.\nThat approach is not just a management neat-idea. There’s a real body of research showing that aligning models to downstream decision goals yields better decisions than optimizing prediction accuracy alone. And there are real, practical wins — from telecom fault detection to inventory systems — when you flip the order. arXiv+1"

The demo gets applause. Then the work hits integration, governance, and the messy reality of people who must make decisions every day. The model’s outputs don’t map to a decision process. So adoption fails.\n\nWhy? Because the project optimized the wrong thing. It optimized prediction metrics — error, F1, AUC, MAPE. And those are useful. But they’re not the measure of business impact. A model with better accuracy can still be useless if it doesn’t change what someone does.\nHarvard Business Review captured this idea well: decisions don’t start with data. They start with a problem, a role, a process, and a behavior. If your analytics don’t connect to that reality, you get slides and disappointment. Harvard Business Review\nThere are more subtle costs too. Dataset-first projects often create models that are brittle in production: they overfit to historical quirks, they require constant data wrangling, and they produce numbers no one trusts.

In the machine-learning community this shows up as “decision-focused learning” or “smart predict-then-optimize.” The idea: train predictive models not for pure accuracy, but to minimize the loss that matters to the downstream optimization or decision task. When you optimize directly for the decision loss, you often get better business outcomes — even with “worse” prediction metrics. arXiv+1\nRecent papers and reviews show both the theory and practical methods: surrogate losses that reflect decision outcomes, techniques to differentiate through optimization, and heuristics for discrete problems. The takeaway: the math supports the intuition. If you want a model to help choose inventory levels, price points, or routing, train it with that decision in mind — not just with RMSE. Optimization Online+1\nThat doesn’t mean every model must be complex. Often the opposite. Framing the decision reduces model complexity because you only model what matters.

Build it before you touch data.\nHere’s the Decision Map — six steps. Do them in order.\n\nName the decision. Who decides, how often, and what options do they choose? Example: “Field-ops decides whether to dispatch a technician to a suspected DSL fault.” Be specific. Frequency matters — hourly, daily, weekly change what you can do.\nDefine the decision metric(s).What counts as success? Lower cost? Faster response time? Increase in net revenue? Pick one primary metric and one secondary. If you can’t name it in a single measurable sentence, you don’t have a decision.\nMap the current process. Where is the decision made today? Which people and tools are involved? Where does data enter? Where do delays happen? This step exposes the friction you must remove.\nIdentify the minimal action the model must trigger. The model doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to change behavior. If the model’s output is a probability, what threshold triggers action? Who gets the alert? What’s the handoff?\nList the minimal signals (data) needed. Only include data that directly reduces uncertainty for the decision. You’ll be surprised how small this list often is. Think: signal → action. Not “all the data.”\nPlan the feedback loop. How will you measure the decision metric after deployment? How will you collect labels and iterate? Decide that upfront.\n\nIf you complete this map, you’ll have done 80% of the work most teams skip. It forces alignment, and it reveals whether the project is worth doing."

The project didn’t begin with “we have logs.” It began with this decision map:\n\nDecision: Should operations dispatch a field technician proactively for a suspected DSL fault?\nMetric: Reduce customer reported faults and improve Net Promoter Score (NPS) by reducing time-to-detect. Also: monthly cost savings from fewer reactive truck rolls and more planned truck rolls.\nProcess: Operations received the customer call, created a ticket, and dispatched if needed — often hours or days later. That was slow and expensive.\n\nAction: If the system flags an anomaly with high confidence\nRed : Very high probability in next 48 hours,\nAmber: probability in next 2-15 days\nGreen: No visibility of error in next 15 days This creates a high-priority ticket and dispatch a remote check or technician and was planned in region wise manner.\n\nSignals: DSL line metrics, error rates, device telemetry, event logs — a handful of streams, not every log.\nFeedback: Compare flagged incidents to customer complaints and adjust thresholds.\n\nBecause the decision was so clear, we could measure value before full scale. The pilot cut detection time from days to hours, raised customer satisfaction significantly ( We sent messages to possible signal disruption early), and saved ~£80K per month ( because reducing complete breakdown to DSL by heat or so and by planning the route than going everywhere) . It wasn’t an exotic model (or may be it was, tech details some other day); it was a tightly scoped system that informed a clear action.\nNotice how this maps to the Decision-First steps. The model existed to change a single operational choice. That focus made deployment possible and measurable fast."

Or you can ask: what decision do merchandisers make with this forecast? When you frame it as “which SKUs do we order for next week, and what reorder points trigger expedited shipments,” you design the forecast differently: shorter horizons, bias for understock on fast movers, and direct constraints on reorder costs.\nI’ve led projects that delivered $11M in inventory optimization by building forecasts and decision rules that match merchant behavior and supply constraints.

Before modeling, define a rule that will be your baseline (e.g., “if X &gt; T, create ticket”).

If you show the board a change in cost or conversion, you’ll get attention.\nPrioritize deployment constraints. Decide telemetry, latency, and handoff requirements first.

Its principle is simple: classify a data point based on the majority class among its ‘k’ nearest neighbors in the feature space. This non-parametric approach makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, rendering it versatile for various applications. KNN is very popular, but it comes with some limitations.\nHowever, KNN’s Achilles’ heel lies in its reliance on distance metrics, which are inherently designed for numerical data. Real-world datasets often contain a mix of numerical and categorical features, posing a significant challenge for KNN. How do you measure the distance between ‘red’ and ‘blue,’ or ‘large’ and ‘small’?\n\nPrior Art\nSeveral strategies have been proposed to adapt KNN for mixed data:\n\nOne-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical features into numerical vectors, but can lead to high dimensionality.\nDistance Functions for Mixed Data: Develops and apply custom distance metrics that can handle both numerical and categorical features such as HEOM and many others.\nUsing mean/mode values: Replace the missing values with mean/mode.\n\nThese methods often involve compromises, either distorting the data’s inherent structure or adding computational overhead."

Here’s the core idea:\n\nTrie-Based Categorical Encoding: A Trie is used to store the categorical features of the data. Each node in the Trie represents a category.\nLeaf-Node KNN Models: At the leaf nodes of the Trie, where specific combinations of categorical features are found, we fit individual KNN models using only the numerical features.\nWeighted Prediction: To classify a new data point, we traverse the Trie based on its categorical features. At each level, we calculate a weighted distance based on available data, ending in a probability score in each leaf node.\n\n\nWhy This Works\n\nNo Direct Distance Calculation for Categorical Features: The Trie structure implicitly captures the relationships between categorical values.\nLocalized KNN Models: By fitting KNN models at the leaf nodes, we ensure that distance calculations are performed only on relevant numerical features.\nScalability: The Trie structure efficiently handles a large number of categorical features and values."

    "section": "The Birth of the Metric: A First-Person Perspective",
    "text": "The Birth of the Metric: A First-Person Perspective\nWhy Existing Methods Fell Short\nEarly in our research, we cataloged limitations of popular evaluation techniques:\n\nMethod Dependency\n\n\n\nSilhouette scores worked beautifully for K-Means but faltered with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).\n\nProbability-based metrics like BIC couldn’t handle distance-based clusters.\n\n\nNoise Blindness\nNoisy variables often contaminated clusters, but traditional methods required manual outlier detection.\nSubjective Optimization* Elbow plots and dendrograms left too much room for human interpretation.\n\n\nOur “Aha!” Moment - Crosstab Sparsity\n\n\n\n\nBest Cluster for K-means Using Crosstab sparsity\n\n\n\nWhile analyzing cross-tab matrices of variable distributions across clusters, we noticed a pattern: well-segregated clusters consistently showed higher frequencies along matrix diagonals. This inspired our two-part metric:\n\n\n\nSegregation Factor:\n# Simplified calculation from our codebase  \nmedian = np.median(cross_tab)  \nN_vk = np.sum(cross_tab &gt; median)  # Count \"well-segregated\" instances  \nExplanation Factor:\nexplanation = np.log(len(data) / (bins * clusters))  \n\n\nSegregation Factor: Measures how distinctly clusters separate data points. We used the median (not mean) to avoid skew from outlier-dominated matrices.\nExplanation Factor: Quantifies how well clusters capture data variability. The logarithmic term penalizes overfitting—a critical insight from debugging early over-segmented clusters.\n\nAnd the Final Formula:\nFor variable \\(v\\) with \\(k\\) clusters:\n\\[\nS_v^k = \\underbrace{\\frac{N_v^k}{\\max(l, k)}}_{\\text{Segregation}} \\times \\underbrace{\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_d}{l \\times k}\\right)}_{\\text{Explanation}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(N_v^k\\): Segregated instances (values above cross-tab matrix median)\n- \\(l\\): Number of value intervals for variable \\(v\\)\n- \\(N_d\\): Total observations\nThis formulation ensures algorithmic invariance, allowing comparison across methods like K-Means (distance-based) and GMM (probability-based). Also, now you can see from the formula two scenarios happens: 1. If each variable crosstab is too dense then their is no separation between classes 2. If each variable crosstab is too sparse then we loose on explanation.\nHence the curve reaches a maximum and then falls down giving use the separability that the cluster can produce:"

Initially, inconsistent results plagued us—until we realized our binning strategy for continuous variables was flawed.\n\n\nKey Adjustments:\n- Switched from equal-width to quantile-based binning (10 bins per variable).\n- For categorical variables, retained native levels instead of coercing bins.\n\n\nThe Breakthrough\nAfter refining the preprocessing:\n\nOptimal Clusters: Our metric plateaued at \\(k=6\\) , aligning perfectly with known vehicle categories (sedans, trucks, etc.).\nNoise Detection: Variables like Max.LWR (length-width ratio) scored poorly, revealing inconsistent clustering.

Equal-width bins distorted scores for skewed variables.\n2. Categorical Handling: Native levels for categorical outperformed frequency-based grouping.\n3. Non-Parametric Approach: This approach allowed us to make sense of data without being tied down by assumptions. We have seen how this metric can be a game-changer for statisticians, providing insights not just into cluster behavior but also into rare event modeling.\nThe plots from these experiments not only clarify how clusters behave but also offer valuable insights for identifying outliers. I believe there’s exciting potential to extend this metric into classification and value estimation modeling. Imagine using it as a loss function in both linear and non-linear methods to achieve better data segmentation! Thing for another blog someday!\n\nA Personal Reflection\nDeveloping this metric taught me that simplicity often masks depth. A two-component formula now underpins clustering decisions in industries we never imagined—from fraud detection to genomics. Yet, I’m most proud of how it democratizes cluster analysis: business analysts at our partner firms now optimize clusters without PhD-level stats.\nYou can find implementation of python code here\nThis blog synthesizes findings from our original paper, available here. For a deeper dive into the math, check Section 3 of the paper.\nTo my readers: Have you tried implementing cross-algorithm clustering?

Everyone of us has experimented on regression using OLS ,MLE, Ridge, LASSO, Robust etc., and also might have evaluated them using RMSE (Root Mean/Median Square Error), MAD (Mean/Median Absolute Deviation), MAE (Mean / Median Absolute Error) and MAPE (Mean/Median Absolute Percentage Error), etc…\nBut all of these gives a single point estimate that what is the overall error looks like. Just a different thought!! can we be sure that this single value of MAPE or MAE? How easy it is to infer that our trained model has fitted well across the distribution of dependent variable?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot of Anscombe’s Quartet\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Descriptive Stats for Anscombe’s Quartet\n\n\nLet me give you a pretty small data-set to play with “The Anscombe’s quartet”. This is a very famous data-set by Francis Anscombe. Please refer the plots below to understand the distribution of y1, y2, y3, y4. Isn’t it different?\nWould the measure of central tendency and disportion be same for this data? I am sure none of us would believe but to our utter surprise we see all the descriptive stats are kind of same. Don’t believe me !!! Please see the results below ( Source: Wikipedia ):"

Unless you change some features or even do a lot of hyper parameter tuning, your results won’t vary much.\nIf you look at the average value of MAPE in each decile you would see an interesting pattern. Let us show you what we see that pattern. One day while working on a business problem where I was using regression on a discussion with Kumarjit, we deviced a different way of model diagnosis. We worked together to give this a shape and build on it.\n\nAs you can see it is absolutely evident that either of the side in the distribution of MAPE values is going wild!!!!!!! Still overall MAPE is good (18%)."

    "text": "Seeking Scope of Improvement\nWe worked together to build a different framework to address such issues on the go and reduce the MAPE deterioration on the edge of the distribution.\nThis problems gives rise to a concept we named as Distribution Assertive Regression (DAR).\nDAR is a framework that is based on cancelling the weakness of one point summaries by using the classical concepts of Reliability Engineering : The Bath Tub Curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot for Classical Bath Tub Curve using a Hazard Function\n\n\nThe Specialty of this curve is that it gives you the likelihood which areas one tends to have high failure rates. In our experiments when we replace failure with MAPE value and the Time with sorted (ascending) value of target / dependent variable, we observe the same phenomenon. This is likely to happen because most of regression techniques assumes Normal (Gaussian) Distribution of data and fits itself towards the central tendency of this distribution.\nBecause of this tendency, any regression methods tends to learn less about data which are away from the central tendency of the target.\nLets look at BostonHousing data from “mlbench” package in R.\n\n\n\nPlot for MAPE Bath Tub Curve for Decile Split “mdev” from Data\n\n\nHere the MAPE is calculated for each decile split of ordered target variable. As you can observe it is following the bath tub curve. Hence the validates our hypothesis that the regression method is not able to understand much about the data at the either ends of the distribution."

Well here it is:\nThe DAR framework splits the data at either ends of the order target variable and performs regression on these “split” data individually. This inherently reduces the so called “noise” part of the data and treat it as an individual data."

So ideally scoring involves two step method :\n\nScore new value against each KNN / Multiclass Classifier model of the data\nBased on closeness we score it with the regression method used for that part of data.\n\nSo now we know how we can improve the prediction power of data for regression."

    "text": "Overview\nAll the practitioners of data science always hit one giant thing to do with data and you know it well its EDA -Exploratory Data Analysis. This word EDA1 was coined by Tukey himself in his seminal book published in 1983. But do you think that before that EDA doesn’t existed ?\n1 Emerson, J. D., & Hoaglin, D. C. (1983). Stem-and-leaf displays. In D. C. Hoaglin, F. Mosteller, & J. W. Tukey (Eds.) Understanding Robust and Exploratory Data Analysis, pp. 7–32. New York: Wiley. Book is here.Well glad you thought. Before that all were doing what is called as Hypothesis Testing. Yes, before this the race was majorly to fit the data and make most unbiased and robust estimate. But remember one thing when you talk about Hypothesis Testing it was always and majorly would be related to RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) a.k.a Randomized Clinical Trials and is Gold Standard of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMore on RCTs and ODs\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let me now not hijack the discussion to what is RCTs and Observational Data (ODs) as it is more of Philosophical Reasoning rather than other quality of data, but essentially what we are trying to find is that can we by, using stats, identify interesting patterns in data.\nThe only thing happens wit RCT data is that we tend to believe these interesting patterns coincide with some sort of ‘Cause-Effect’ kind of relationship. But essentially due to bia nature of ODs, we certainly cant conclude this. And hence, can only find interesting patterns.\n\n\n\nLets move on. The big question is, for whatever reason you are doing HT , you are doing it for finding something intreating. And that something interesting is usually found by using Post-Hoc Tests. Now there are variety of Post-Hocs available but what is more know and hence easily found to be implemented in Tukey’s HSD.\nSo lets directly jump to how to follow this procedure. We’ll be using bioinfokit for this, as it is much simpler wrapper around whats implemented in statsmodels."

    "text": "Cross Roads where everyone meets!\n\n\n\nIntroduction: A Journey into Data\nPicture this: you’re standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, the wind whipping around you as you watch a colony of Palmer Penguins waddling about, oblivious to the data detective work you’re about to embark on. As a data science architect, you’re not just an observer; you’re a sleuth armed with algorithms and insights, ready to unravel the mysteries hidden within data. Today, we’ll transform raw numbers into powerful narratives using CrossTab Sparsity as our guiding compass. This blog post will demonstrate how this metric can revolutionize classification tasks, shedding light on many fascinating datasets—the charming Palmer Penguins and the serious Obesity, Credit cards data and many more.\n\n\nThe Power of CrossTab Sparsity\n\nWhat is CrossTab Sparsity?\nCrossTab Sparsity isn’t just a fancy term that sounds good at dinner parties; it’s a statistical measure that helps us peer into the intricate relationships between categorical variables. Imagine it as a magnifying glass that reveals how different categories interact within a contingency table. Understanding these interactions is crucial in classification tasks, where the right features can make or break your model (and your day).\nWhy Does It Matter?\nIn the world of data science, especially in classification, selecting relevant features is like picking the right ingredients for a gourmet meal—get it wrong, and you might end up with something unpalatable. CrossTab Sparsity helps us achieve this by:\n\nHighlighting Relationships: It’s like having a friend who always points out when two people are meant to be together—understanding how features interact with the target variable.\nStreamlining Models: Reducing complexity by focusing on significant features means less time spent untangling spaghetti code.\nEnhancing Interpretability: Making models easier to understand and explain to stakeholders is like translating tech jargon into plain English—everyone appreciates that!\n\n\n\n\nData Overview: Our Data People at work here\n\nThe Datasets\nData 1: Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition\nLittle bit about the data: This dataset, shared on 8/26/2019, looks at obesity levels in people from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia based on their eating habits and physical health. It includes 2,111 records with 16 features, and classifies individuals into different obesity levels, from insufficient weight to obesity type III. Most of the data (77%) was created using a tool, while the rest (23%) was collected directly from users online.\nData 2: Predict Students’ Dropout and Academic Success\nLittle bit about the data: This dataset, shared on 12/12/2021, looks at factors like students’ backgrounds, academic path, and socio-economic status to predict whether they’ll drop out or succeed in their studies. With 4,424 records across 36 features, it covers students from different undergrad programs. The goal is to use machine learning to spot at-risk students early, so schools can offer support. The data has been cleaned and doesn’t have any missing values. It’s a classification task with three outcomes: dropout, still enrolled, or graduated\nKey Features:\n\nMulticlass: Both data set cater a multi class problems with NObeyesdad and Target columns\nMixed Data Type: A good mix of categorical and continuous variables are available for usage.\nSizeable: More than 2 K rows are available for testing.\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Setting the Stage\nBefore we dive into model creation, let’s explore our dataset through some quick EDA. Think of this as getting to know your non-obese friends before inviting them to a party.\n\nEDA for Obesity Data\nHere’s a brief code snippet to perform essential EDA on the Obesity dataset:\n\n\nLoading data and generating basic descriptive\n# Load the Obesity data\nraw_df = pd.read_csv('ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv')\ntarget = 'NObeyesdad'\n\n# Load Students data\n\n# Load Credit data\n# raw_data = sm.datasets.get_rdataset(\"credit_data\",'modeldata')\n# raw_df = raw_data.data\n# target = 'Status'\n\n# # Load Palmer penguins data\n# raw_data = sm.datasets.get_rdataset(\"penguins\",'palmerpenguins')\n# raw_df = raw_data.data\n# target = 'species'\n\n\n# # Load Credit data\n# raw_data = sm.datasets.get_rdataset(\"CreditCard\",'AER')\n# raw_df = raw_data.data\n# target = 'card'\n\n\n# setting things up for aal the next steps\nraw_df[target] = raw_df[target].astype('category') \nprint('No of data points available to work:',raw_df.shape)\ndisplay(raw_df.head())\n\n\n# Summary statistics\ndisplay(raw_df.describe())\n\n\nNo of data points available to work: (2111, 17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\nAge\nHeight\nWeight\nFamil_Hist_Owt\nFAVC\nFCVC\nNCP\nCAEC\nSMOKE\nCH2O\nSCC\nFAF\nTUE\nCALC\nMTRANS\nNObeyesdad\n\n\n\n\n0\nFemale\n21.0\n1.62\n64.0\nyes\nno\n2.0\n3.0\nSometimes\nno\n2.0\nno\n0.0\n1.0\nno\nPublic_Transportation\nNormal_Weight\n\n\n1\nFemale\n21.0\n1.52\n56.0\nyes\nno\n3.0\n3.0\nSometimes\nyes\n3.0\nyes\n3.0\n0.0\nSometimes\nPublic_Transportation\nNormal_Weight\n\n\n2\nMale\n23.0\n1.80\n77.0\nyes\nno\n2.0\n3.0\nSometimes\nno\n2.0\nno\n2.0\n1.0\nFrequently\nPublic_Transportation\nNormal_Weight\n\n\n3\nMale\n27.0\n1.80\n87.0\nno\nno\n3.0\n3.0\nSometimes\nno\n2.0\nno\n2.0\n0.0\nFrequently\nWalking\nOverweight_Level_I\n\n\n4\nMale\n22.0\n1.78\n89.8\nno\nno\n2.0\n1.0\nSometimes\nno\n2.0\nno\n0.0\n0.0\nSometimes\nPublic_Transportation\nOverweight_Level_II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\nHeight\nWeight\nFCVC\nNCP\nCH2O\nFAF\nTUE\n\n\n\n\ncount\n2111.000000\n2111.000000\n2111.000000\n2111.000000\n2111.000000\n2111.000000\n2111.000000\n2111.000000\n\n\nmean\n24.312600\n1.701677\n86.586058\n2.419043\n2.685628\n2.008011\n1.010298\n0.657866\n\n\nstd\n6.345968\n0.093305\n26.191172\n0.533927\n0.778039\n0.612953\n0.850592\n0.608927\n\n\nmin\n14.000000\n1.450000\n39.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n19.947192\n1.630000\n65.473343\n2.000000\n2.658738\n1.584812\n0.124505\n0.000000\n\n\n50%\n22.777890\n1.700499\n83.000000\n2.385502\n3.000000\n2.000000\n1.000000\n0.625350\n\n\n75%\n26.000000\n1.768464\n107.430682\n3.000000\n3.000000\n2.477420\n1.666678\n1.000000\n\n\nmax\n61.000000\n1.980000\n173.000000\n3.000000\n4.000000\n3.000000\n3.000000\n2.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget distribution\n\n\nTarget and Correlation\n# Visualize target data distribution\nplt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))\nsns.countplot(data=raw_df, x=target, hue=target, palette='Set2',)\nplt.title(f'Distribution of {target} levels')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()\n\n# Heatmap to check for correlations between numeric variables\ncorr = raw_df.corr('kendall',numeric_only=True)\nsns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.title('Kendall Correlation Heatmap')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneSome Mode EDA for the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDA code\n# Visualize the distribution of numerical variables\nsns.pairplot(raw_df, hue=target, corner=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n# Gettign Categorical data\ncategorical_columns = raw_df.select_dtypes(include='object').columns\n\n# Plot categorical variables with respect to the target variable\nfor col in categorical_columns:\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))\n    sns.countplot(data=raw_df,x=col, hue=target)\n    plt.title(f\"Countplot of {col} with respect to {target}\")\n    plt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Creation: Establishing a Baseline\nWith our exploratory analysis complete, we’re ready to create our baseline model using logistic regression with Statsmodels.

It’s like cleaning up your closet and only keeping the clothes that spark joy (thank you, Marie Kondo). 1\n1 This is based on work in Unique Metric for Health Analysis with Optimization of Clustering Activity and Cross Comparison of Results from Different Approach. Paper LinkCode is here!\n\n\nStandared Steps for Feature Selection\n\nCalculate CrossTab Sparsity: For each feature against the target variable.\nSelect Features: Based on sparsity scores that indicate significant interactions with the target variable.\nRecreate Models: Train new models using only the selected features—less is often more!\n\nHere we go!!!\n\n\n\nDoing what needs to Done Code ;)\nsns.set_style(\"white\")\nsns.set_context(\"paper\")\n# Calculating Crostab sparsity for each Column\nresults = crosstab_sparsity(data_df_train.iloc[:,:-1],data_df_train[target],numeric_bin='decile')\n\n# presenting results for consumption\ndf_long = pd.melt(results['scores'], id_vars=['Columns'], value_vars=['seggregation', 'explaination', 'metric'],\n                  var_name='Metric', value_name='values')\n\n# Adding jitter: small random noise to 'Columns' (x-axis)\n# df_long['values_jittered'] = df_long['Value'] + np.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1, size=len(df_long))\n\n# Create a seaborn scatter plot with jitter, more professional color palette, and transparency\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))\nsns.scatterplot(x='Columns', y='values', hue='Metric', style='Metric',\n        data=df_long, s=100, alpha=0.7, palette='deep')\n\n# Title and labels\nplt.title('Metrics by Columns', fontsize=16)\nplt.xticks(rotation=45) \nplt.xlabel('Columns', fontsize=10)\nplt.ylabel('Value', fontsize=10)\n\n# Display legend outside the plot for better readability\nplt.legend(title='Metric', loc='upper right', fancybox=True, framealpha=0.5)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\nCSP calculated with decile for breaks!\n\nScores for 7 groups(s) is : 140.96057955229762\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Drum Rolls pelase!!!\nUsing just top 5 varaibles we are getting almost similar or better overall accuracy.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Uh OH! :(\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to know how to code?\n\n\n\nNo. The AI Profit OS is designed for senior professionals, not engineers. Everything is built in Excel + simple tools you already use. If you can use Google Sheets, you can build these systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m not technical. Will I be able to follow?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely. This training is designed for business leaders, not data scientists. I’ve trained CFOs, COOs, and Senior Directors with zero technical background. If you can manage a P&L, you can operationalize AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I can’t attend all 3 days live?\n\n\n\nYou’ll get lifetime recording access. However, the live workshops where you build YOUR specific systems are where the real value comes from. We strongly recommend attending live.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this just ChatGPT training?\n\n\n\nNo. ChatGPT is one tool in the AI Profit OS, but the system is much bigger. You’ll learn: (a) How to structure your workflow for AI leverage, (b) How to build repeatable systems (not one-off prompts), (c) How to measure ROI and scale what works.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat industries does this work for?\n\n\n\nIf you’re a senior professional doing knowledge work, this works. I’ve deployed AI systems across automotive, retail, FMCG, telecommunications, finance, and healthcare. The frameworks are industry-agnostic.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the refund policy?\n\n\n\nThe “Unheard Of” Guarantee (see above). If you implement the system and don’t save 10+ hours/week within 30 days, refund + ₹5,000 paid to you. After 30 days, no refunds - but you can transfer your seat to a colleague.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I bring my team?\n\n\n\nYes! We offer team pricing for 3+ participants from the same organization. Email jitin@jitinkapila.com for custom team rates. (Recommended: Bring 2-3 key leaders to accelerate adoption.)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is this different from other AI courses?\n\n\n\nMost AI courses teach theory or simple prompting. The AI Profit OS is a complete operational system you’ll deploy in your workflow. You’re not learning about AI - you’re building leverage. By Day 3, you have working systems saving you time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if AI changes? Will this become outdated?\n\n\n\nThe OLCD Protocol, AI-ART Matrix, and operational frameworks are model-agnostic. Whether it’s ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever comes next, the system adapts. Plus, you get lifetime access to framework updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m not sure this will work for my specific industry/role.\n\n\n\nThat’s exactly why Day 1 is focused on YOUR workflow and YOUR 90-day roadmap. The frameworks are industry-agnostic, but the implementation is personalized to your reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n₹7,999 feels expensive for a training.\n\n\n\nCompare it to: - (a) One hour of my consulting at ₹25,000/hour, -(b) The cost of being replaced by a 22-year-old who knows how to use AI, -(c) The ₹6.9Cr the grocery chain saved with this exact system. If you don’t save 10+ hours/week, I’ll refund you AND pay you ₹8,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I can’t implement this alone?\n\n\n\nYou won’t be alone. You’ll join a private community of senior professionals building AI systems. Plus monthly office hours with me. And if you need hands-on implementation support, 1:1 consulting is available.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I know this isn’t just hype?\n\n\n\nLook at the results: ₹6.9Cr grocery chain savings. $11M automotive optimization. £80K/month retail revenue lift. These are real deployments at Mercedes, L’Oréal, Maruti, British Telecom. This isn’t theory - it’s operational leverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if AI replaces me anyway?\n\n\n\nAI will replace professionals who DON’T learn to operationalize it. Senior professionals who build AI systems become 10x more valuable. You’re not competing with AI - you’re building leverage ON TOP of your 10+ years of expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
