# My Blogging Evolution: From Jekyll's Depths to Quarto's Data Science Peak

The realm of blogging platforms is expansive and constantly evolving, offering solutions for every niche. As a data science architect, my journey through this landscape has been a search for the ideal tool—one that integrates with my workflow, supports my use of R and Python, and enables me to share insights efficiently. This quest has led me from Jekyll to Hugo, and finally, to the data science-focused environment of Quarto. Let me recount this evolution.

### The Beginning: [Jekyll's ](https://jekyllrb.com/) Promise and Problems

Around 2015, *Jekyll* was a leading choice for static site generation. It promised a simple, static blog, but the reality had its challenges. The setup was relatively straightforward, but as a data scientist, I encountered significant drawbacks. My workflow involved R and Python code, and integrating these into blog posts was cumbersome. I spent more time tweaking Ruby and HTMLthan writing, which wasn't ideal.

*It was an inefficient process that stifled creativity*. I needed a platform that understood the needs of data scientists, allowing seamless integration of code, narrative, and visuals. Despite its initial appeal, [*Jekyll proved more of a hindrance*](https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/static_sites.html) :disappointed_relieved:

### A Glimmer of Hope: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

Next, I discovered *Hugo*, along with the *blogdown* package in R. This combination allowed me to write blog posts directly in R Markdown, which was revolutionary. I created shortcodes that suited my style, and *writing in R Markdown was a game-changer*.

However, my enthusiasm was short-lived. As I shifted more towards Python for development, I faced the same old problem: *juggling between environments*. The dream of a unified workflow remained [out of reach](https://rasmusnes.com/posts/hugo_vs_quarto/).

### The Ideal: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

Then came *Quarto*. This has been transformative. Quarto is designed for researchers and data scientists, supporting both R and Python seamlessly. I started migrating my site in early 2022, and the transition was smooth. *I built my site, deployed it on Netlify*, and finally had a natural and intuitive workflow.

_Quarto allowed me to focus on content_. I could write, code, and visualize without leaving my data science environment. Its support for multiple output formats made adapting content for different channels easy.

### The Hiatus and the Return

Life intervened, and blogging took a backseat during 2023 and early 2024.

*Now, I'm back*. The goal is to blog *better*, creating content that sparks conversations and pushes data science communication. I aim to leverage Quarto's full capabilities, building an engaging and informative blog, dashboards and whatever is possible. The plan is to distribute content across multiple channels and build a community. _Fingers crossed, I won't stop this time_. :v:

# Lessons Learned and Resources

My blogging journey has taught me valuable lessons:

1.  **Choose the Right Tool**: The platform impacts your productivity. Select one that aligns with your workflow.
2.  **Embrace Simplicity**: Focus on creating content and let the platform handle the rest.
3.  **Stay Consistent**: Consistency is key. Maintain a realistic schedule.
4.  **Engage with Your Audience**: Interact with readers and build a community.
